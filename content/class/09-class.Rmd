<!-- Concerns around the _reproducibility crisis_ are not simply a function of transparency in methodology and research design. Rather, they relate to a culture and incentive structure whereby scientific claims are conferred with authority when reported within the (slightly backwards) logic of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and _p-values_. We will cover a little on this in session 7 and 8, but for an accessible read on the phenomenon of _p-hacking_ (with interactive graphic) see [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1) from the excellent [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) website. Again, the upshot of all this introspection is a rethinking of the way in which Statistics is taught in schools and universities, with greater emphasis on understanding through computational approaches rather than traditional equations, formulas and probability tables. Where does `R` fit within this? Simply put: `R` is far better placed than traditional software tools and point-and-click paradigms for supporting computational approaches to statistics -- with a set of methods and libraries for performing simulations and permutation-based tests. -->
