Storytelling not about making up stories – but constructing evidence-based arguments, with authority and uncertainty. Point at tensions – need to reduce complexity (and uncertainty) can lead to false interpretation.  From Data Driven Storytelling\n*We think this movement towards data-driven stories, which is apparent in both the data visualization research community and the professional journalism community, has the potential to form a crucial part of keeping the public informed, a movement sometimes referred to as the democratization of data – the making of data understandable to the general public. This exciting new development in the use of data visualization in media has revealed an emerging professional community in the already complex group of disciplines involved in data visualization. Data visualization has roots in many research fields including perception, computer graphics, design, and human-computer interaction, though only recently has this expanded to include journalism.\nData journalism here has also been a growing consciousness that some of today’s most relevant stories are buried in data. This data can be quite hard to understand in its raw formats but can become much more generally accessible when visualized. Journalists have not only begun to use standard data visualizations such as charts and maps in their stories, but are also creating new ones that are tailored to the particular data type and to the message of the story they are writing. Since journalists are now able to easily share interactive data visualizations on the Web, the democratization of data visualization is accelerating with new compelling data visualizations emerging in the media daily…\nBy carefully structuring the information and integrating explanation to guide the consumer, journalists help lead readers towards a valid interpretation of the underlying data. *\n  Amanda Cox - https://www.youtube.com/embed/ha9LA3rYD9g Robert Kosara - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMtWFjjVM5E\u0026amp;amp;ab_channel=BocoupLLC   Scrollytelling : https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964\nStorytelling models?\nStorytelling narratives – immigration : https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/25322/\nNot sure about this resource : https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one/delivering-data/using-visualizations-to-tell-stories\nTalk: John Burn-Murdoch VIS 2020 on Covid-19 comparison work.

In this first session we’ll cover the background to the module – the why, what and how of vis-for-gds. If you’ve not already you should check out the course outline on the Syllabus page for an overall preview of the module.\nThe main home for this module is this website. However, via Minerva you can access the Module Handbook. You will use submission boxes in Minerva to upload coursework in the usual way.\n Why vis-for-gds? Geographic Data Science It is now taken-for-granted that over the last decade or so new data, new technology and new ways of doing science have transformed how we approach the world’s problems. Evidence for this can be seen in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Enter Covid19 github into a search and you’ll be confronted with hundreds of repositories demonstrating how an ever-expanding array of data related to the pandemic can be collected, processed and analysed. Data Science is a term used widely to capture this shift and Geographic Data Science (GDS), probably first discussed coherently by Arribas-Bel and Reades (2018) and Singleton and Arribas-Bel (2019), when observing that many of data science’s applications are – or at least should be – of inherent interest to geographers.\nSince gaining traction in the corporate world, the definition of Data Science has been somewhat stretched, but it has its origins in the work of John Tukey’s The Future of Data Analysis (1962). Drawing on this, and a survey of more recent work, Donoho (2017) neatly identify six key facets that a data science discipline might encompass1 :\ndata gathering, preparation, and exploration; data representation and transformation; computing with data; data visualization and presentation; data modelling; and a more introspective “science about data science”   Geographic Data Science and Visualization Visualization is fundamental to meeting the unprecedented challenges and exploiting the wonderful opportunities of the ever-expanding deluge of data confronting virtually every field.\" \\  -- Prof. Jim Hollan of UC San Diego --  Visual approaches to data analysis are particularly suited to Geographic Data Science applications because where datasets are being repurposed for social and natural sciences research for the first time, contain complex structure and geo-spatial relations that cannot be easily captured by statistical summaries alone and so where the types of questions that can be asked and the techniques deployed to answer them cannot be easily specified in advance.   -- Glancing at this list, visualization could be interpreted as a single facet of Data Science process2 – something that happens after data gathering, preparation, exploration, but before modelling. In this module you’ll learn that visualization is intrinsic to, and should inform, each of these activities, especially so when working with data sets that are spatial – for Geographic Data Science.\nLet’s develop this idea by asking why data visualizations are used in the first place. In her book Visualization Analysis and Design, Tamara (???) considers how humans and computers interface in the decision-making process. She makes the point that data visualization is ultimately about connecting people with data in order to make decisions – or to install humans in a ‘decision-making-loop’. There are occasionally decision-making loops that are entirely computational and where an automated solution exists and is trusted. However, most require some form of human intervention.\nThe canonical example demonstrating how relying on computation alone can be problematic, and so for the use of visualization, is Anscombe’s quartet. Here, Anscombe (1973) presents four datasets, each containing eleven observations and two variables for each observation. The data are synthetic, but let’s say that they are the weight and height of independent samples taken from a population of Postgraduate Students studying Data Science.\nPresented with a new dataset it makes sense to compute some summaries and doing so, we observe that the data appear identical – they contain the same means, variances and strong positive correlation coefficient. This seems appropriate since the data are measuring weight and height. Although there may be some variation, we’d expect taller students to be heavier. Given these statical summaries we can be confident that we are drawing samples from the same population of (Data Science) students.\n Figure 1: Data from Anscombe’s quartet  Laying out the data in a meaningful way, horizontally according to weight (x) and vertically according to the height (y) to form a scatterplot, we quickly see that whilst these data contain the same statistical properties they are very different. Only dataset #1 now looks plausible if it were truly a measure of weights and heights drawn from a population of students.\nAnscombe’s is a deliberately contrived example3, but there are real cases of important structure being missed, leading to poorly specified models and potentially faulty claims.\n Figure 2: Plots of Anscombe’s quartet  This is not to undermine the importance of numerical analysis. Numeric summaries that simplify patterns are extremely useful and Statistics has at its disposal an array of tools for helping to guard against making false claims from datasets – a theme that we will return to in session 6, 7 and 8 when we think critically about the use of visual approaches for data anlysis. There remain, though, certain classes of relation and context that cannot be easily captured through statistics alone.\nGeographic context is undoubtedly challenging to capture numerically; many of the early examples of data visualization have been of spatial phenomena and generated by Geographers (see Friendly 2007). We can also probably make a special case for the use of visual approaches in Geographic Data Science (GDS) applications due to its exploratory nature. Often in GDS datasets are being repurposed for social and natural sciences research for the first time; contain complex structure and geo-spatial relations that cannot be easily captured by statistical summaries alone; and so the types of questions that can be asked and the techniques deployed to answer them cannot be easily specified in advance. In this module we will demonstrate this as we explore (Session 4 and 5), model under uncertainty (Session 6 and 7) and communicate (Session 7 and 8) with various social science datasets.\n  Watch Jo Wood’s talk demonstrating how visual techniques can be used to analyse urban travel behaviours. In the video Jo argues that bikeshare schemes can help democratise cycling, but also for their potential contributions to research – he briefly contrasts new, passively collected data sets with more “traditional” actively collected data for analysing how people move around cities. A compelling case is then made for the use of visualization to support this activity. This work and further discussion is published in Beecham and Wood (2014).     Effective data visualizations should expose structure in data that would be difficult to expose through non-visual means --   What vis-for-gds? This is a very practical module. With the exception of this Introduction, the weekly sessions will blend both theory and practical coding activity. We will cover fundamentals around visual data analysis from Information Visualization and Statistics. As you read the session materials you will be writing data processing and analysis code and so be generating analysis outputs of your own. We will also be working with real datasets – from the Political Science, Urban and Transport Planning and Health domains. So we will hopefully be generating real findings and knowledge.\nTo do this in a genuine way – to generate real knowledge from datasets – we will have to cover a reasonably broad set of data processing and analysis procedures. As well as developing expertise around designing data-rich, visually compelling graphics (of the sort demonstrated in Jo Wood’s TEDx talk), we will need to cover more tedious aspects of data processing and wrangling. Additionally, if we are to learn how to generate and communicate and make claims under uncertainty with our data graphics, then we will need to cover some aspects of estimation and modelling from Statistics. In short, we will cover most of Donoho (2017)’s six key facets of a data science discipline:\ndata gathering, preparation, and exploration (Sessions 2, 3, 5); data representation and transformation (Sessions 2, 3); computing with data (Session 2); data visualization and presentation (All Sessions); data modelling (Sessions 6, 7, 8); and a more introspective “science about data science” (All Sessions, Plus Optional Extra)  There is already a rich and impressive set of open Resources practically introducing how to do modern Data Science, Visualization and Geographic Analysis. We will certainly draw on these at different stages in the module. What makes this module different from these existing resources is that we will be doing applied data science throughout – we will be identifying and diagnosing problems when gathering data, discovering patterns (some maybe even spurious) as we do exploratory analysis, and attempt to make claims under uncertainty as we generate models based on observed patterns. We will work with both new, passively-collected datasets, as well as more traditional, actively collected datasets located within various social science domains: Political Science, Health Science and Urban and Transport Planning.\n How vis-for-gds? R for modern data analysis Through the module we will apply modern approaches to data analysis. All data collection, analysis and reporting activity will be completed using R and the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Released as open source software as part of a research project in 1995, for some time R was the preserve of academics. From 2010s onwards, the R community expanded rapidly and along with Python is regarded as the key technology for doing data analysis. R is used increasingly outside of academia, by organisations such as Google [example], Facebook [example], Twitter [example], New York Times [example], BBC [example] and many more.\nThere are many benefits that come from being fully open-source, with a critical mass of users. Firstly, there is an array of online forums, tutorials and code examples from which to learn. Second, with such a large community, there are numerous expert R users who themselves contribute by developing libraries or packages that extend its use. As a result R is employed for a very wide set of use cases – this website was even built in R using amongst other things the blogdown package.\n  The key reason for our use of R is the ecosystem of users and packages that have emerged in recent years. An R package is a bundle of code, data and documentation, usually hosted on the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).   Of particular importance is the tidyverse package. This is a set of packages for doing Data Science authored by a software development team at RStudio led by Hadley Wickham. tidyverse packages share a principled underlying philosophy, syntax and documentation. Contained within the tidyverse is its data visualization package, ggplot2. This package pre-dates the tidyverse – it started as Hadley Wickham’s PhD thesis and is one of the most widely-used toolkits for generating data graphics. As with other heavily used visualization toolkits (Tableau, vega-lite) it is inspired by Leland Wilkinson’s The Grammar of Graphics, the gg in ggplot stands for Grammar of Graphics. Understanding the design principles behind the Grammar of Graphics (and tidyverse) is necessary for modern data analysis and so we will cover this in Sessions 2 and 3, as well as re-visiting later in the module.\n Rmarkdown for reproducible research  Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.\nRoger Peng, Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo\n In recent years there has been much introspection around how science works – around how statistical claims are made from reasoning over evidence. This came on the back of, amongst other things, a high profile paper published in Science, which found that of 100 recent peer-reviewed psychology experiments, the findings of only 39 could be replicated. The upshot is that researchers must now make every possible effort to make their work transparent, such that “all aspects of the answer generated by any given analysis [can] be tested” (Brunsdon and Comber 2020).\nA reproducible research project should be accompanied with:\n code and data that allows tables and figures presented in research outputs to be regenerated code and data that does what it claims (the code works) code and data that can be justified and explained through proper documentation  If these goals are met, then it may be possible for others to use the code on new and different data to study whether the findings reported in one project might be replicated or to use the same data, but update the code to, for example, extend the original analysis (to perform a re-analysis). This model – generate findings, test for replicability in new contexts and re-analysis – is essentially how knowledge development has always worked. However, to achieve this the data and procedures on which findings were generated must be made open and transparent.\nIn this setting, traditional proprietary data analysis software such as SPSS and Esri’s ArcGIS that support point-and-click interaction is problematic. First, whilst these software may rely on the sorts of packages and libraries with bundled code that R and Python uses for implementing statistical procedures, those libraries are closed. It is not possible, and therefore less common, for the researcher to fully interrogate into the underlying processes that are being implemented and the results need to be taken more or less on faith. Second, but probably most significantly (for us), it would be tedious to make notes describing all interactions performed when working with a dataset in SPSS or ArcGIS.\nAs a declarative programming language, it is very easy to provide such a provenance trail for your workflows in R since this necessarily exists in the analysis scripts. But more importantly, the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) through which R (and Python) are most often accessed provide notebook environments that allow users to curate reproducible computational documents that blend input code, explanatory prose and outputs. In this module we will prepare these sorts of notebooks using R Markdown.\n  Getting started with R and RStudio I mentioned that the weekly sessions will blend both theory and practical coding activity. This Introduction has been dedicated more towards conceptual and procedural matters. For the practical element this time, we want to get you configured and familiar with R and RStudio.\nInstall R and RStudio  Install the latest version of R. Note that there are installations for Windows, macOS and Linux. Run the installation from the file you downloaded (an .exe or .pkg extension). Install the latest version of RStudio Desktop. Note again that there are separate installations depedning on operating system – for Windows an .exe extension, macOS a .dmg extension.   Open the RStudio IDE  Figure 3: The RStudio IDE   Once installed, open the RStudio IDE. Open an R Script by clicking File \u0026gt; New File \u0026gt; R Script .  You should see a set of windows roughly similar to those in the Figure (although I’ve already started on some of the computing exercises in the next section). The top left pane is used either as a Code Editor (the tab named Untitled1) or data viewer. This is where you’ll write, organise and comment R code for execution or inspect datasets as a spreadsheet representation. Below this in the bottom left pane is the R Console, in which you write and execute commands directly. To the top right is a pane with the tabs Environment and History. This displays all objects – data and plot items, calculated functions – stored in-memory during an R session. In the bottom right is a pane for navigating through project directories, displaying plots, details of installed and loaded packages and documentation on their functions.\n Compute in the console You will write and execute almost all code from the code editor pane. To start though let’s use R as a calculator by typing some commands into the Console. You’ll create an object (x) and assign it a value using the assignment operator (\u0026lt;-), then perform some simple statistical calculations using functions that are held within the base package.\n  The base package is core and native to R. Unlike all other packages, it does not need to be installed and called explicitly. One means of checking the package to which a function you are using belongs is to call the help command (?) on that function: e.g. ?mean().    Type the commands contained in the code block below into your R Console. Notice that since you are assigning values to each of these objects they are stored in memory and appear under the Global Environment pane.  # Create variable and assign a value. x \u0026lt;- 4 # Perform some calculations using R as a calculator. x_2 \u0026lt;- x^2 # Perform some calculations using functions that form baseR. x_root \u0026lt;- sqrt(x_2)  Install some packages There are two steps to getting packages down and available in your working environment:\ninstall.packages(\u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt;) downloads the named package from a repository. library(\u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt;) makes the package available in your current session.   Install the tidyverse, the core collection of packages for doing Data Science in R, by running the code below:  install.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) If you have little or no experience in R, it is easy to get confused around downloading and then using packages in a session. For example, let’s say we want to make use of the simple features package (sf), which we will drawn on heavily in the module for performing spatial operations.\n Run the code below:  library(sf) Unless you’ve previously installed sf, you’ll probably get an error message that looks like this:\n\u0026gt; Error in library(sf): there is no package called ‘sf’ So let’s install it.\n Run the code below:  install.packages(\u0026quot;sf\u0026quot;) And now it’s installed, why not bring up some documentation on one of its functions (st_contains()).\n Run the code below:  ?st_contains() Since you’ve downloaded the package but not made it available to your session, you should get the message:\n\u0026gt; No documentation for ‘st_contains’ in specified packages and libraries So let’s try again, by first calling library(sf).\n Run the code below:  library(sf) ## Linking to GEOS 3.7.2, GDAL 2.4.1, PROJ 6.1.0 ?st_contains() Now let’s install some of the remaining core packages on which the module depends.\n Run the block below, which passes a vector of package names to the install.packages() function:  install.packages(c(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;usethis\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rmarkdown\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;knitr\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;fst\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lubridate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tidymodels\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rmapshaper\u0026quot;))   If you wanted to make use of a package only very occasionally in a single session, you could access it without explicitly loading it via library(\u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt;), using this syntax: \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt;::\u0026lt;function_name\u0026gt;, e.g. ?sf::st_contains().    Experiment with R Markdown R Markdown documents are suffixed with the extension .Rmd and based partly on Markdown, a lightweight markup language originally used as a means of minimising tedious mark-up tags (\u0026lt;header\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt;) when preparing HTML documents. The idea is that you trade some flexibility in the formatting of your HTML for ease-of-writing. Working with R Markdown is very similar to Markdown. Sections are denoted hierarchically with hashes (#, ##, ###) and emphasis using * symbols (*emphasis* **added** reads emphasis added ). Different from standard Markdown, however, R Markdown documents can also contain code chunks that can be run when the document is typeset – they are a mechanism for producing elegant reproducible notebooks.\nEach session of the module has an accompanying R Markdown file. in later sessions you will use these to author computational notebooks that blend code, analysis prose and outputs.\n Download the  01-template.Rmd file for this session and open it in RStudio by clicking File \u0026gt; Open File ... \u0026gt; \u0026lt;your-downloads\u0026gt;/01-template.Rmd.  A quick anatomy of an R Markdown files :\n YAML - positioned at the head of the document and contains metadata determining amongst other things the author details and the output format when typesetting. TEXT - incorporated throughout to document and comment on your analysis. CODE chunks - containing discrete that are to be run when the .Rmd file is typeset or knit.   Figure 4: The anatomy of R Markdown  The YAML section of an .Rmd file controls how your file is typeset and consists of key: value pairs enclosed by ---. Notice that you can change the output format – so should you wish you can generate for example .pdf, .docx files for your reports.\n--- author: \u0026quot;Roger Beecham\u0026quot; date: \u0026#39;2021-05-01\u0026#39; title: \u0026quot;Session 01\u0026quot; output:html_document --- R Markdown files are rendered or typeset with the Knit button, annotated in the Figure above. This starts the knitr package and executes all the code chunks and outputs a markdown (.md) file. The markdown file can then be converted to many different output formats via pandoc.\n Knit the  01-template.Rmd file for this session, either by clicking the Knit button or by typing ctrl + ⇧ + K on Windows, ⌘ + ⇧ + K on macOS.  You will notice that R Markdown code chunks can be customised in different ways. This is achieved by populating fields in the curly brackets at the start of the code chunk:\n```{r \u0026lt;chunk-name\u0026gt;, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE} # Some code that is either run or rendered. ``` A quick overview of the parameters.\n \u0026lt;chunk-name\u0026gt; - Chunks can be given distinct names. This is useful for navigating R markdown file. It also supports chaching – chunks with distinct names are only run once, important if certain chunks take some time to execute. echo=\u0026lt;TRUE|FALSE\u0026gt; - Determines whether the code is visible or hidden from the typeset file. If you output file is a data analysis report you may not wish to expose lengthy code chunks as these may disrupt the discursive text that appears outside of the code chunks. eval=\u0026lt;TRUE|FALSE\u0026gt; - Determines whether the code is evaluated (executed). This is useful if you wish to present some code in your document for display purposes. cache=\u0026lt;TRUE|FALSE\u0026gt; - Determines where the results from the code chunk are cached.  As part of the homework from this session you will do some more research on R Markdown. It is worth in advance downloading RStudio’s cheatsheets, which provide comprehensive details on how to configure R Markdown documents:\n Open RStudio and select Help \u0026gt; Cheatsheets \u0026gt; R Markdown Cheat Sheet | R Markdown Reference Guide   R Scripts Whilst there are obvious benefits to working in R Markdown documents when doing data analysis, there may be occasions where working in an script is preferable. Scripts are plain text files with the extension .R. Comments – text that are not executed as code – are denoted with the # symbol.\nI tend to use R Scripts for writing discrete but substantial code blocks that are to be executed. For example, I might generate a set of functions that relate to a particular use case and bundle these together in an R script. These then might be referred to in a data analysis from an .Rmd, which makes various use of these functions in a similar way as one might import a package. Below is an example script that we will encounter later in the module when creating flow visualizations in R very similar to those that appear in Jo Wood’s TEDx talk. This script is saved with the fie name bezier_path.R. If it were stored in a sensible location, like a project’s code folder, it could be called from an R Markdown file with source(./code/bezier_path). R Scripts can be edited in the same way as R Markdown files in RStudio, via the Code Editor pane.\n# bezier_path.R # # Author: Roger Beecham ############################################################################## #\u0026#39; Functions for generating input data for asymmetric bezier curve for OD data, #\u0026#39; such that the origin is straight and destination curve.

They are really useful for quickly developing bits of code. This can be achieved by highlighting over the code that you wish to execute and clicking the Run icon at the top of the Code Editor pane or by typing ctrl + rtn on Windows, ⌘ + rtn on macOS\n Create an RStudio Project  Figure 5: Creating an RStudio Project  Throughout this module we will use project-oriented workflows. This is where all files pertaining to a data analysis – data, code and outputs – are organised from a single root folder and where file path discipline is used such that all paths are relative to the project’s root folder (see Bryan \u0026amp; Hester 2020). You can imagine that this sort of self-contained project set-up is necessary for achieving reproducibility of your research. They allow anyone to take a project and run it on their own machines without having to make any adjustments.\nYou might have noticed that when you open RStudio it automatically points to a working directory, likely the home folder for your local machine, denoted with ~/ in the Console. RStudio will by default save any outputs to this folder and will also expect any data you use to be saved there. Clearly if you want to incorporate neat, self-contained project workflows then you will want to organise your work from a dedicated project folder rather than the default home folder for your machine. This can be achieved with the setwd(\u0026lt;path-to-your-project\u0026gt;) function. The problem with doing this is that you insert a path which cannot be understood outside of your local machine at the time it was created. This is a real pain. It makes simple things like moving projects around on your machine an arduous task and most importantly it hinders reproducibility if others are to reuse your work.\nRStudio Projects are a really excellent feature of the RStudio IDE that resolve these problems. Whenever you load up an RStudio Project, R starts up and the working directory is automatically set to the project’s root folder. If you were to move the project elsewhere on your machine, or to another machine, a new root is automatically generated – so RStudio projects ensure that relative paths work.\nLet’s create a new Project for this module:\n Select File \u0026gt; New Project \u0026gt; New Directory. Browse to a sensible location and give the project a suitable name. Then click Create Project.  You will notice that the top of the Console window now indicates the root for this new project, in my case ~projects/vis-for-gds.\n In the root of your project, create folders called reports, code, data, figures. Save this session’s  01-template.Rmd file to the reports folder.  Your project’s folder structure should now look like this:\nvis-for-gds\\ vis-for-gds.Rproj code\\ data\\ figures\\ reports\\ 01-template.Rmd   Conclusions Visual data analysis approaches are necessary for exploring complex patterns in data and to make and communicate claims under uncertainty. This is especially true of Geographic Data Science applications, where:\n datasets are being repurposed for social and natural sciences research for the first time; contain complex structure and geo-spatial relations that cannot be easily captured by statistical summaries alone; and, consequently, where the types of questions that can be asked and the techniques deployed to answer them cannot be easily specified in advance.  In this module we will demonstrate this as we explore (Session 4 and 5), model under uncertainty (Session 6 and 7) and communicate (Session 7 and 8) with various social science datasets. We will work with both new, large-scale behavioural datasets, as well as more traditional, administrative datasets located within various social science domains: Political Science, Crime Science, Urban and Transport Planning.\nWe will do so using the statistical programming environment R, which along with Python, is the programming environment for modern data analysis. We will make use of various tools, software libraries that form part of the R ecosystem – the tidyverse for doing modern data science and R Markdown for authoring reproducible research projects.\n References Anscombe, F. 1973. “Graphs in Statistical Analysis.” American Statistician 27 (1): 17–21. doi:10.1080/00031305.1973.10478966.\n Arribas-Bel, Dani, and Jon Reades. 2018. “Geography and Computers: Past, Present, and Future.” Geography Compass 12 (10): e12403. doi:10.1111/gec3.12403.\n Beecham, Roger, and Jo Wood. 2014. “Exploring Gendered Cycling Behaviours Within a Large-Scale Behavioural Data-Set.” Transportation Planning and Technology 37 (1).

Introduction This session outlines the fundamentals of visualization design. It offers a position on what effective data graphics should do, before discussing in detail the processes that take place when creating data graphics. You will learn that there is a framework – a vocabulary and grammar – for supporting this process which, combined with established knowledge around visual perception, can be used to describe, evaluate and create effective data graphics. Talking about a vocabulary and grammar of data and graphics may sound alien and abstract, the preserve of Computer Scientists. However, through an analysis of 2019 General Election results data we will demonstrate that these concepts underpin most visual data analysis.\n  Watch Miriah Meyer’s TEDx talk, Information Visualization for Scientific Discovery, which provides a nice introduction to many of the concepts covered in the session.      Concepts Characteristics of effective data graphics Data graphics take numerous forms and are used in many different ways by scientists, journalists, designers and many more. Whilst the intentions of those producing data graphics varies, those that are effective generally have the following characteristics:\nRepresent complex datasets graphically to expose structure, connections and comparisons that could not be achieved easily via other means. Are data rich: present many numbers in a small space. Reveal patterns at several levels of detail: from broad overview to fine structure. Have elegance – emphasise dimensions of a dataset without extraneous details. Generate an aesthetic response that encourages people to engage with the data or question.    Considering these characteristics, take a look at the data graphics below, which present an analysis of the 2016 US Presidential Election. Use the links to read the full stories and accompanying data analyses.    Figure 1: Maps of 2016 US presidential election results. Left - two-colour choropleth in Medium. Right - information-rich data graphic in The Washington Post.  Both maps use 2016 county-level results data, but the The Washington Post graphic encodes many more data items than the Medium post (see Table 1 below).\nIt is not simply the data density that makes the Washington Post graphic successful. The authors usefully incorporate annotations and transformations in order to support comparison and emphasise structure. By varying the height of triangles according to the number of votes cast, the thickness according to whether or not the result for Trump/Clinton was a landslide and rotating the scrollable map 90 degrees, the very obvious differences between metropolitan, densely populated coastal counties that voted emphatically for Clinton and the vast number of suburban, provincial town and rural counties (everywhere else) that voted Trump, are exposed.\n  Table 1: Data items encoded in the Washington Post and Medium articles.    Data item  Data measurement level  Washington Post  Medium      county location  Ratio (cyclic)        county result  Nominal        state result  Nominal       county votes cast (~pop size)  Ratio       county result margin  Ratio       county result landslide  Nominal         Grammar of Graphics  Data graphics visually display measured quantities by means of the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, and color.\nTufte (1983)\n In evidence in the Washington Post graphic is a judicious mapping of data to visuals, underpinned by a secure understanding of analysis context. This act of carefully considering how best to leverage visual systems given the available data and analysis priorities is key to designing effective data graphics.\nIn the late 1990s Leland Wilkinson, a Computer Scientist and Statistician, introduced the Grammar of Graphics as an approach that formalises this process of turning data into visuals. Wilkinson (1999)’s thesis is that if graphics can be described in a consistent way according to their structure and composition, then the process of generating graphics of different types can be systematised. This has obvious benefits for building visualization toolkits: it makes it easy to specify chart types and combinations and helps formalise the process of designing data visualizations. vega-lite, Tableau and ggplot2 are all underpinned by Grammar of Graphics thinking.\nWilkinson (1999)’s grammar separates the construction of a data graphic into a series of components. Below are the components of the Layered Grammar of Graphics on which ggplot2 is based (Wickham 2010), a slight edit on Wilkinson (1999)’s original work.\n Figure 2: Components of Wickham (2010)’s Layered Grammar of Graphics.  The seven components in Figure 2 are together used to create ggplot2 specifications. The aspects to emphasise at this stage are those in emphasis, which are required in any ggplot2 specification: the data containing the variables of interest, the geom or marks to be used to represent data and the aesthetic (mapping=aes(...)) attributes, or visual channels through which variables are to be encoded.\nTo demonstrate this, let’s generate some scatterplots based on the 2019 General Election data we will be analysing later in the session. Two variables worth exploring for association here are: con_1719, the change in Conservative vote share by constituency between 2017-2019, and leave_hanretty, the size of the Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum, estimated at Parliamentary Constituency level (see Hanretty 2017).\n Figure 3: Plots, grammars and associated ggplot2 specifications for the scatterplot.  In Figure 3 are three plots and associated ggplot2 specifications. Reading-off the graphics and the associated code, you should get a feel for how ggplot2 specifications are constructed:\nWe start with a data frame, in this case each observation is an electoral result for a Parliamentary Constituency. In the ggplot2 spec this is passed using the pipe operator (data_ge %\u0026gt;%). We also identify the variables we wish to encode and their measurement type. Remembering last session’s materials, both con_1719 and leave_hanretty are ratio scale variables. Next is the encoding (mapping=aes()), which determines how the data are to be mapped to visual channels. A scatterplot is a 2d representation in which horizontal and vertical position varies in a meaningful way, in response to the values of a data set. Here the values of leave_hanretty are mapped along the x-axis and the values of con_1719 are mapped along the y-axis. Finally, we represent individual data items with marks using the geom_point geometry.  In the middle plot, the grammar is updated such that the points are coloured according to winning_party, a variable of type categorical nominal. In the bottom plot constituencies that flipped from Labour-to-Conservative between 2017-19 are emphasised by varying the transparency (alpha) of points. I have described flipped as an ordinal variable, but strictly it is a nominal (binary) variable. Due to the way it is encoded in the plot – constituencies that flipped (flipped=TRUE) are given greater visual emphasis – I think it is more appropriate to call it an ordinal variable.\n  It is understandable if at this stage the specifications in Figure 3 still seem alien to you. We will be updating, expanding and refining ggplot2 specifications throughout this module to support all aspects of modern data analysis – from data cleaning and exploratory analysis through to model evaluation and communication.    Marks and visual channels  Effective data visualization design is concerned with representing data through marks and visual channels in a way that best conveys the properties of the data that are to be depicted.\nvia Jo Wood\n You might have noticed that in my descriptions of ggplot2 specifications I introduced marks as another term for geometry and visual encoding channels as another term for aesthetics. I also paid special attention to the data types that are being encoded.\nMarks are graphical elements such as bars, lines, points, ellipses that can be used to represent data items – in ggplot2, these are accessed through the functions prefaced with geom_*. Visual channels are attributes such as colour, size, position that, when mapped to data, control the appearance of marks in response to the values of a dataset. Not all channels are equally effective. In fact we can say confidently that for particular data types and tasks, some channels perform better than others.\nMarks and channels are terms used in the interface of Tableau and in vega-lite specifications. They are also used widely in Information Visualization, an academic discipline devoted to the study of data graphics, and most notably by Tamara Munzner (2014) in her textbook Visualization Analysis and Design. Munzner (2014)’s work is important and widely adopted as it synthesises over foundational research in Information Visualization and Cognitive Science testing how effective different visual channels are at supporting different tasks.\n Figure 4: Visual channels to which data items can be encoded, as they appear in Munzner (2014).  Figure 4 is taken from Chapter 5 of Munzner (2014) and lists the main visual channels with which data might be encoded. The grouping and order of the Figure is meaningful. Channels are grouped according to the tasks to which they are best suited and then ordered according to their effectiveness at supporting those tasks. To the left are magnitude:order channels – those that are best suited to tasks aimed at quantifying data items. Tothe Right are identify:category channels – those that are most suited to supporting tasks that involve isolating, grouping and associating data items.\nWe can use this organisation of visual channels to make decisions about appropriate encodings given a variable’s measurement level. If we wished to convey the magnitude of something, for example a quantitative (ratio) variable like the size of the Conservative vote share in a constituency, we might select a channel that has good quantitative effectiveness – position on a common scale or length. If we wished to also effectively identify and associate constituencies according to the political party that was elected, a categorical nominal variable, we might select a channel that has good associative properties such as colour hue.\n Evaluating designs The effectiveness rankings of visual channels in Figure 4 are not simply based on Munzner’s preference. They are informed by detailed experimental work – Cleveland and McGill (1984), later replicated by Heer and Bostock (2010) – which involved conducting controlled experiments testing people’s ability to make judgements from graphical elements. We can use Figure 4 to help make decisions around which data item to encode with which visual channel. This is particularly useful when designing data-rich graphics, where several data items are to be encoded simultaneously. The Figure also offers a low cost way of evaluating different designs against their encoding effectiveness. To illustrate this, we can use Munzner’s ranking of channels to evaluate the Washington Post graphic discussed in Figure 1.\n  Table 2: Encoding effectiveness for Washington Post graphic that emphasises vote margin and size of counties using triangle marks.    Mark  Data item  Type  Channel  Rank     Magnitude:Order         Location  ratio (cyclic)  position in x,y  quant          Votes cast (~pop size)  ratio  length  quant          Margin  ratio  length  quant          Landslide  ordinal  area  quant   Identify:Category          Winner  nominal  colour hue  cat      Table 2 provides a summary of the encodings used in the version of the graphic emphasising vote margin and size. US counties are represented using a peak-shaped mark (). The key purpose of the graphic is to depict the geography of voting outcomes, and so the most effective quantitative channel – position on an aligned scale – is used to order the county marks () with a 2D geographic arrangement. With the positional channels taken, the two quantitive measures, votes cast and result margin, are encoded with the next highest ranked channel, 1D length: height varies according to number of votes cast and width according to result margin. The marks are additionally encoded with two categorical variables: whether the county-level result was a landslide and also the ultimate winner. Since the intention is to give greater visual saliency to counties that resulted in a landslide, this as an ordinal variable, encoded with a quantitative channel: 2D area. The winning party, a categorical nominal variable, is encoded using colour hue.\nEach of the encoding choices used in the graphic follow conventional wisdom in that data items are encoded using visual channels that are appropriate to their measurement level. Glancing down the “rank” column we can also argue that the graphic has high effectiveness. Whilst technically spatial region is the most effective channel for encoding nominal data, it is already in use in our graphic as the  marks are arranged by geographic position. Additionally, it makes sense to distinguish Republican and Democrat wins using the colours with which they are always represented. Given the fact that the positional channels are in use to represent geographic location, length to represent votes cast and vote margin, the only superior visual channel to 2D area that could be used to encode the landslide variable is orientation. There are very good reasons for not varying the orientation of the  marks. Most obvious is that this would clearly undermine perception of length encodings used to represent the vote margin (width) and absolute vote size (height).\n  Data visualization design almost always involves trade-offs. When deciding on a design configuration, it is necessary to prioritise analysis tasks and data and match representations and encodings that are most effective to the tasks that are most important. This then constrains the encoding options for less important data items and tasks. Good visualization design is sensitive to this interplay between tasks, data and encoding.    Symbolisation  Symbolization is the process of encoding something with meaning in order to represent something else. Effective symbol design requires that the relationship between a symbol and the information that symbol represents (the referent) be clear and easily interpreted.\nWhite (2017)\n Implicit in the discussion above, and when making design decisions, is the importance of symbolisation. Scrolling through the original Washington Post article, the overall pattern that can be discerned is of population-dense coastal and metropolitan counties voting Democrat – densely-packed, tall, wide and blue  marks – contrasted against population-sparse rural and small town areas voting Republican – short, wide and red  marks. The graphic evokes a distinctive landscape of voting behaviour, emphasised by its caption: “The peaks and valleys of Trump and Clinton’s support”.\nSymbolisation is used equally well in the variant of the graphic emphasising two-party Swing between the 2012 and 2016 elections. Each county is represented as a | mark. The Swing variable is then encoded by continuously varying mark angles: counties swinging Republican are angled to the right /; counties swinging Democrat are angled to the left \\. Although angle is a less effective channel at encoding quantities than is length, there are obvious links to the political phenomena in the symbolisation – angled right for counties that moved to the right politically. Additionally, the variable itself might be regarded as cyclic – or at least it has a ceiling with an important mid-point that requires emphasis. It is worth taking a second look at the full graphic here. Since there is spatial autocorrelation in case trajectories, we quickly assemble from the graphic dominant patterns of Swing to the Republicans (Great Lakes, rural East Coast), predictable Republican stasis (the mid west) and to detect more isolated, locally exceptional Swings to the Democrats (rapidly urbanising counties in the deep south).\n Checking perceptual rankings I mentioned that Munzner’s effectiveness ordering of visual channels is informed by empirical evidence – controlled experiments that examine perceptual abilities at making judgements from graphical primitives. It is worth elaborating a little on this experimental work, and on how established knowledge in Cognitive Science can be used to inform design choices.\nCleveland (1993) emphasises three perceptual activities that take place when we make sense of data graphics:\n Detection : the element of the graphic must be easily discernible. Assembly : the process of identifying patterns and structure within the graphical elements of the visualization. Estimation : the process of making comparisons of the magnitudes of data items from the visual elements used.  These activities can be related to the categories of task outlined earlier. Detection is especially important for selective and associative tasks that involve isolating and grouping data items, whilst estimation is necessary for tasks that are orderable and quantitative, involving the ranking and reading-off of quantities.\nDetection and preattentive processing A useful distinction when considering graphical cognition is between processes that are attentive and pre-attentive (Ware 2008). Attentive processing describes the conscious processing that happens when we attempt to make sense of a visual field. Preattentive processing happens unconsciously and is the type of cognitive processing that allows something to be understood ‘at a glance’. Visual items that immediately pop-out to us induce preattentive processing.\nThe ability to provoke pop-out – making some things on a data graphic more easily detectible than others – relates to detection. It can be useful for supporting selective and associative tasks, and so is often used in a data graphic to encode categorical variables. For example, in the Washington Post graphic the use of colour hue to differentiate and group together counties that voted Republican or Democrat. Preattentive processes can also apply to assembly. We naturally construct and assemble patterns that are smooth and continuous when perceiving a graphic and so deviations from this continuity are often attended to unconsciously. An example here would be those urbanising counties in the deep South, which were locally exceptional in swinging to Democrat (to the left).\nWe can test this preattentive processing by using visual encoding channels to assist a task that requires us to select and associate visual items. Below are a set of data graphics containing 200 numbers. The graphics are currently hidden, but can be revealed by clicking the  icon. For each graphic I want you to scan across the number, isolate or select the number 3, then group or associate the 3s together and count the number of instances that they occur. Speed is important here – so work as quickly as you can.\nFirst, a set of numbers without applying any special encoding to the number 3.\n Encoding: none\n  Figure 5: Encoding: none.  \n Isolate/select 3 from the list of numbers and count its number of occurrences.   If you were racing to complete the task, I imagine you found it moderately stressful. Let’s explore using visual encoding to off-load some of this cognitive effort. We’ll start with a visual channel that does not have particularly strong preattentive properties: area.\n Encoding: area\n  Figure 6: Encoding: area.  \n Isolate/select 3 from the list of numbers and count its number of occurrences.   Using visualization to support the task makes it an order of magnitude easier. But let’s explore some visual channels that have even more powerful properties. I mentioned that tilt/angle has preattentive properties where the data items to be emphasised deviate from some regular pattern. In the graphic below, the number 3 is encoded with tilt or angle.\n Encoding: angle\n  Figure 7: Encoding: tilt/angle.  \n Isolate/select 3 from the list of numbers and count its number of occurrences.   This is in fact more challenging than the size encoding. I think this is most likely because the geometric patterns of the marks used (numbers) is being varied and so this limits the extent to which we unconsciously perceive smoothness and continuity (e.g. limits assembly).\nNext we’ll use a visual channel with known effectiveness at assisting select and associate tasks. Colour hue appears as the second-ranked most effective in Munzner (2014)’s ordering.\n Encoding: colour hue\n  Figure 8: Encoding: colour hue.  \n Isolate/select 3 from the list of numbers and count its number of occurrences.   Finally, though a slightly contrived example, we can use the top-ranked channel according to Munzner (2014): spatial region.\n Encoding: spatial region\n  Figure 9: Encoding: spatial region.  \n Isolate/select 3 from the list of numbers and count its number of occurrences.    Estimation The informal tests above hopefully persuade you of Munzner (2014)’s ordering of identity:category channels in the right side of Figure 4. The ranking of magnitude:order channels is also informed by established theory and evidence.\nWhen using data graphics to communicate quantities, certain visual channels are known to induce biases. Psychophysics is a branch of psychology that develops methods aimed at capturing the often non-linear relationship between the properties of a stimuli such as symbol length, area or colour value, and their perceived response. Stevens’ power law is an empirically-derived relationship that models this effect. The power function takes the form:\n\\(R=kS_n\\)\nWhere \\(S\\) is the magnitude of the stimulus, for example, the absolute length of a line or area of a circle, \\(R\\) is the response, the perceived length and area, and \\(_n\\) is the power law exponent that varies with the type of stimulus. If there is a perfect linear mapping between the stimulus and response, \\(_n\\) is 1.\nStevens and Guirao (1963)’ experimental work involved varying the length of lines and areas of squares and deriving power functions for their perception. For length, an exponent of ~1.0 was estimated; for area an exponent of 0.7. So whilst variation in length is accurately perceived, we underestimate the size of areas as they increase. Flannery (1971)’s work, which was concerned with the perception of quantities in graduated point maps, estimated an exponent of 0.87 for the perception of circle size.\nExperimental findings vary and so these models of human perception are also subject to variation. Nevertheless, corrections can be applied. In cartography a Flannery compensation is used when representing quantities with area.\n Figure 10: Differences in power law exponents for the perception of variation in length and area.    This early experimental work that tries to understand how encoded quantities are perceived is clearly important. But we use data graphics to do much more than estimate single quantities. If data graphics are to serve as tools for analysis, we also need some confidence that the inferences made when studying data using graphics are accurate and reliable. In the Information Visualization domain, experimental work has recently been published exploring the perception of statistical quantities – dispersion (Correll and Gleicher 2014), correlation (Rensink and Baldridge 2010; Chang 2014; Kay and Heer 2016) and spatial autocorrelation (Klippel, Hardisty, and Li 2011; Beecham et al. 2017) – in commonly used chart types. More on this later in the module.     Colour As demonstrated in the section on preattentive processing, colour is very powerful visual channel. When considering how to encode data with colour, it is helpful to consider three properties:\n Hue : what we generally refer to as “colour” in everyday life – red, blue green, etc. Saturation : how much of a colour there is. Luminance/Brightness : how dark or light a colour is.  The underlying rule when using colour in data graphics is to use properties of colour that match the properties of the data. Categorical nominal data – data that cannot be easily ordered – should be encoded using discrete colours with no obvious order: colour hue. Categorical ordinal data – data whose categories can be ordered – should be encoded with colours that contain an intrinsic order: saturation or brightness, usually allocated into gradients. Quantitative data – data that can be ordered and contain values on a continuous scale – should also be encoded with colours that contain an intrinsic order: saturation or brightness, expressed on a continuous scale.\nAs we will discover shortly, these principles are applied by default in ggplot2, along with access to perceptually uniform schemes. Its brewer scales, for example.\n  There are many considerations when using colour to support visual data analysis and communication – and we will return to these at various points in the module. Read Lisa Charotte-Rost’s Guide to Colours in Data Visualization before processing to the Techniques section.     Techniques The technical element to this session involves analysing data from the 2019 UK General Election, reported by Parliamentary Constituency. After importing and describing the dataset, you will generate data graphics that expose patterns in voting behaviour. You will do so by writing ggplot2 specifications.\n Download the  03-template.Rmd file for this session and save it to the reports folder of your vis-for-gds project. Open your vis-for-gds project in RStudio and load the template file by clicking File \u0026gt; Open File ... \u0026gt; reports/03-template.Rmd.  Import The template file lists the required packages – tidyverse, sf and also the parlitools. Installing parlitools brings down the 2019 UK General Election dataset, along with other constituency-level datasets. Loading it with library(parlitools) makes these data available to your R session.\nThe dataset containing 2019 UK General Election data is called bes_2019. This contains results data released by House of Commons Library. We can get a quick overview in the usual way – with a call to glimpse(\u0026lt;dataset-name\u0026gt;). The dataset’s variables are also described on the parlitools web pages. You will notice that bes_2019 contains 650 rows, one for each Parliamentary Constituency, and 118 columns. Contained in the columns are variables reporting vote numbers and shares for the main political parties for 2019 and 2017 General Elections, as well as names and codes (IDs) for each Parliamentary Constituency and the county, region and country in which they are contained. You might want to count the number of counties and regions in the UK, and the number of constituencies contained by counties and regions, using some of the dplyr functions introduced in the last session – for example with calls to group_by() and count().\nThe aim of this analysis session is to get you familiar with ggplot2 specifications. We will be replicating some of the visual data analysis of the 2019 UK General Election in Beecham (2020), inspired by the Washington Post graphic. For this we need to calculate an additional variable – Butler Swing (Butler and Van Beek 1990) – which represents the average change in share of the vote won by two parties contesting successive elections. Code for calculating this variable (named swing_con_lab) is in the  03-template.Rmd. Although initially intuitive, the measure takes a little interpretation. A Swing to the Conservatives, which we observe most often in this dataset, could happen in three ways:\nAn increase in Conservative vote share and a decrease in Labour vote share. An increase in both Conservative and Labour vote share, but with the Conservative increase outstripping that of Labour’s. A decrease in both Conservative and Labour vote share, but with the Conservative decline being less severe than that of Labour’s.  Different from the US where “third parties” play a negligible role, scenarios 2 and 3 do occur in the UK. You will notice that swing_con_lab is a signed value: positive indicates a Swing to Conservative, negative a Swing to Labour.\nThe only other dataset to load is a .geojson file containing the geometries of constituencies, collected originally from ONS Open Geography Portal and simplified using mapshaper. This is a special class of data frame containing a Simple Features geometry column – more on this later in the module.\n Summarise You will no doubt be familiar with the ultimate result of the 2019 General Election – a landslide Conservative victory that confounded expectations. To start, we can quickly compute some summary statistics around the vote. In the code block below, we count the number of seats won by party and overall vote share by party. For the latter, my code is a little more elaborate than I intended it to be. I needed to reshape the data frame using pivot_wider() such that each row represents a vote for a party in a constituency. From here I computed in a single function the vote share for each party.\nWhilst the Conservative party hold 56% of constituencies, they won only 44% of the vote share. The equivalent stats for Labour are 31% and 32% respectively. Incidentally, whilst the Conservatives increased their share of constituencies from 2017 (where they had just 317, 49% of constituencies) their vote share increase was reasonably small – in 2017 they gained 42.5% of the vote.\n# Number of constituencies won by party. bes_2019 %\u0026gt;% group_by(winner_19) %\u0026gt;% summarise(count=n()) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(count)) ## # A tibble: 11 x 2 ## winner_19 count ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 Conservative 365 ## 2 Labour 202 ## 3 Scottish National Party 48 ## 4 Liberal Democrat 11 ## 5 Democratic Unionist Party 8 ## 6 Sinn Fein 7 ## 7 Plaid Cymru 4 ## 8 Social Democratic \u0026amp; Labour Party 2 ## 9 Alliance 1 ## 10 Green 1 ## 11 Speaker 1 # Share of vote by party. bes_2019 %\u0026gt;% select(constituency_name, total_vote_19, con_vote_19:alliance_vote_19) %\u0026gt;% # Select cols containing vote counts by party. pivot_longer(cols=con_vote_19:alliance_vote_19, names_to=\u0026quot;party\u0026quot;, values_to=\u0026quot;votes\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # Pivot to make each row a vote for a party in a constituency. mutate(party=str_extract(party, \u0026quot;[^_]+\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% # Use some regex to pull out party name. group_by(party) %\u0026gt;% summarise(vote_share=sum(votes, na.rm=TRUE)/sum(total_vote_19)) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(vote_share)) ## # A tibble: 12 x 2 ## party vote_share ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 con 0.436 ## 2 lab 0.321 ## 3 ld 0.115 ## 4 snp 0.0388 ## 5 green 0.0270 ## 6 brexit 0.0201 ## 7 dup 0.00763 ## 8 sf 0.00568 ## 9 pc 0.00479 ## 10 alliance 0.00419 ## 11 sdlp 0.00371 ## 12 uup 0.00291 Below are some summary statistics computed over the newly created swing_con_lab variable. As the Conservative and Labour votes are negligible in Northern Ireland, it makes sense to focus on Great Britain for our analysis of Con-Lab Swing and so the first step in the code is to create a new data frame filtering out Northern Ireland. We will work with this for the rest of the session.\ndata_gb \u0026lt;- bes_2019 %\u0026gt;% filter(region!=\u0026quot;Northern Ireland\u0026quot;) data_gb %\u0026gt;% summarise( min_swing=min(swing_con_lab), max_swing=max(swing_con_lab), median_swing=median(swing_con_lab), num_swing=sum(swing_con_lab\u0026gt;0), num_landslide_con=sum(con_19\u0026gt;50, na.rm=TRUE), num_landslide_lab=sum(lab_19\u0026gt;50, na.rm=TRUE) ) ## # A tibble: 1 x 6 ## min_swing max_swing median_swing num_swing num_landslide_con num_landslide_lab ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 -6.47 18.4 4.44 599 280 120  Plot distributions  Figure 11: Histograms of Swing variable.  Let’s get going with some ggplot2 specifications by plotting some of these variables. Below is the code for plotting a histogram of the Swing variable.\ndata_gb %\u0026gt;% ggplot(mapping=aes(swing_con_lab)) + geom_histogram() A reminder of the general form of the ggplot2 specification (first covered inGrammar of Graphics section):\nStart with some data: data_gb. Define the encoding: mapping=aes(). In this case, we want to summarise over the swing_con_lab variable. Specify the marks to be used: geom_histogram() in this case.  Different from the scatterplot example, there is more happening in the internals of ggplot2 when creating a histogram. Technically geom_histogram is what Munzner (2014) would describe as a chart idiom rather than a mark (geometric primitive). The Swing variable is partitioned into bins and observations in each bin are counted. The x-axis (bins) and y-axis (counts by bin) is therefore derived from the supplied variable (swing_con_lab). Should you wish, you could enter ?geom_histogram for fuller detail and documentation around controlling bin sizes amongst other things.\nYou will notice that by default the histogram’s bars are given a grey colour. To set them to a different colour, add a fill= argument to geom_histogram(). In the code block below, colour is set using hex codes – \"#003c8f\", based on the theme for this course website. I use the term set here and not map or encode and there is a principled explanation for this. Any part of a ggplot2 specification that involves encoding data – mapping data to a visual channel – should be specified through the mapping=aes() argument. Anything else, for example changing the default colour of marks, their thickness and transparency, needs to be set outside of this argument.\ndata_gb %\u0026gt;% ggplot(mapping=aes(swing_con_lab)) + geom_histogram(fill=\u0026quot;#003c8f\u0026quot;) + labs( title=\u0026quot;Butler two-party Labour-Conservative Swing for Constituencies in GB\u0026quot;, subtitle=\u0026quot;-- 2019 versus 2017 election\u0026quot;, caption=\u0026quot;Data published by House of Commons Library, accessed via `parlitools`\u0026quot;, x=\u0026quot;Swing\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;count\u0026quot; ) You might have noticed that different elements of a ggplot2 specification are added (+) as layers. In the example above, the additional layer of labels (labs()) is not intrinsic to the graphic. However, often you will add layers that do affect the graphic itself: for example the scaling of encoded values (e.g. scale_*_continuous()) or whether the graphic is to be conditioned on another variable to generate small multiples for comparison (e.g. facet_*()).\n  Read this design story by Lunzner and McNamara, 2020 for an excellent discussion of the analysis and design considerations when working with histograms. There are of course other geoms for summarising over 1D distributions: geom_boxplot(), geom_dotplot(), geom_violin().   Faceting by region  Figure 12: Histograms of Swing variable, grouped by region.  Adding a call to facet_*(), we can quickly compare how Swing varies by region (as in Figure 12). The plot is annotated with the median value for Swing (4.4) by adding a vertical line layer (geom_vline()) and setting its x-intercept at this value. From this, there is some evidence of a regional geography to the 2019 vote: London and Scotland are particularly distinctive in containing relatively few constituencies swinging greater than the expected midpoint; North East, Yorkshire \u0026amp; The Humber, and to a lesser extent West and East Midlands, appear to show the largest relative number of constituencies swinging greater than the midpoint. It was this graphic, especially the fact that London and Scotland look different from the rest of the country, that prompted the scatterplots in Figure 3 comparing gain in Conservative vote shares against the Brexit vote.\n  Plot ranks/magnitudes  Figure 13: Plots of vote shares by party.  Previously we calculated overall vote share by Political Party. We could continue the exploration of votes by region by re-using this code to generate plots displaying quantities but also comparing region, using marks and encoding channels that are suitable for magnitudes.\nTo generate a bar chart similar to the left of Figure 13 the ggplot2 specification would be:\ndata_gb %\u0026gt;% \u0026lt;some dplyr code\u0026gt; %\u0026gt;% # The code block summarising vote by party. ... %\u0026gt;% # \u0026lt;summarised data frame\u0026gt; %\u0026gt;% # The summarised data frame of vote share by party, piped to ggplot2. ggplot(aes(x=reorder(party, -vote_share), y=vote_share)) + # Categorical-ordinal x-axis (party, reordered), Ratio y-axis (vote_share). geom_col(fill=\u0026quot;#003c8f\u0026quot;) + # Set colour by website theme. labs( title=\u0026quot;Vote share by party in GB\u0026quot;, subtitle=\u0026quot;-- 2019 UK General Election\u0026quot;, caption=\u0026quot;Data published by House of Commons Library, accessed via `parlitools`\u0026quot;, x=\u0026quot;party\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;vote share\u0026quot; )+ theme_v_gds() # A theme I\u0026#39;ve created for. A quick breakdown of the specification:\nData: This is the summarised data frame in which each row is a political party and the column describes the vote share recorded for that party. Encoding: I have dropped the mapping=. ggplot2 always looks for aes() and so can save some code clutter. In this case we are mapping party to the x-axis, a categorical variable made ordinal by the fact that we reorder the axis left-to-right descending according to vote_share. vote_share is mapped to the y-axis – so encoded using bar length, on an aligned scale, an effective channel for conveying magnitudes. Marks: geom_col() for generating the bars. Setting: Again, I’ve set bar colour according to the website theme and included titles and captions. I also set the theme to a custom theme I have created for this module theme_v_gds(). Optionally we add a coord_flip() layer in order to display the bars horizontally. This makes the category axis labels easier to read and also seems more appropriate for the visual “ranking” of bars.    ggplot2 themes control the appearance of all non-data items – font sizes and types, gridlines, axes labels. Checkout the complete list of ggplot2’s default themes. If you like the look of the BBC’s in-house data graphics – I do (or at least I like many of them) – explore their Data Journalism cookbook. In fact I’d recommend working through the cookbook as it is a great resource for distilling many of the non-data-related decisions that are made when communicating graphically.   Faceting by region  Figure 14: Plots of vote shares by party and region.  In Figure 14 the graphic is faceted by region. This requires an updated derived dataset grouping by vote_share and region and of course adding a faceting layer (geom_facet(~region)) to the ggplot2 specification. The graphic is more data-rich, but additional cognitive effort is required in relating the bars representing political parties between different graphical subsets. We can assist this identify and associate task by encoding the bars with an appropriate visual channel: colour hue. The ggplot2 specification for this is as you would expect – we add a mapping to geom_col() and pass the variable name party to the fill argument (aes(fill=party).\n\u0026lt;derived_data\u0026gt; %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(party, vote_share), y=vote_share)) + geom_col(aes(fill=party)) + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~region) + labs( title=\u0026quot;Vote share by party in GB\u0026quot;, subtitle=\u0026quot;-- 2019 UK General Election\u0026quot;, caption=\u0026quot;Data published by House of Commons Library, accessed via `parlitools`\u0026quot;, x=\u0026quot;party\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;vote share\u0026quot; )+ theme_v_gds() Trying this for yourself, you will observe that the ggplot2 internals are clever here. Since party is a categorical variable, a categorical (hue-based) colour scheme is automatically applied. Try passing a quantitative variable (fill=vote_share) and see what happens.\nClever as this is, when encoding political parties with colour symbolisation is important. More control over the encoding is necessary in order to specify the colours with which parties are most commonly represented. We can override ggplot2’s default colour by adding a scale_fill_manual() layer into which a vector of hex codes describing the colour of each political party is passed (party_colours). We also need to tell ggplot2 which element of party_colours to apply to which value of party. In the code below, a derived table is generated summarising vote_share by political party and region. In the final line the party variable is recoded as a factor. You might recall from last session that factors are categorical variables of fixed and potentially orderable values, called levels. The call to mutate() recodes party as a factor variable and orders the levels according to overall vote share.\n# Generate derived data. temp_party_shares_region \u0026lt;- data_gb %\u0026gt;% select(constituency_name, region, total_vote_19, con_vote_19:alliance_vote_19) %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(cols=con_vote_19:alliance_vote_19, names_to=\u0026quot;party\u0026quot;, values_to=\u0026quot;votes\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(party=str_extract(party, \u0026quot;[^_]+\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% group_by(party, region) %\u0026gt;% summarise(vote_share=sum(votes, na.rm=TRUE)/sum(total_vote_19)) %\u0026gt;% filter(party %in% c(\u0026quot;con\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lab\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ld\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;snp\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;brexit\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pc\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(party=factor(party, levels=c(\u0026quot;con\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lab\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ld\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;snp\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;brexit\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pc\u0026quot;))) Next, a vector of objects is created containing the hex codes for the colours of political parties (party_colours). This is a named vector, with names assigned from the levels of the party variable that was just created.\n# Define colours. con \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#0575c9\u0026quot; lab \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#ed1e0e\u0026quot; ld \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#fe8300\u0026quot; snp \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#ebc31c\u0026quot; green \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#78c31e\u0026quot; pc \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#4e9f2f\u0026quot; brexit \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#25b6ce\u0026quot; other \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;#bdbdbd\u0026quot; party_colours \u0026lt;- c(con, lab, ld, snp, green, brexit, pc) names(party_colours) \u0026lt;- levels(temp_party_shares %\u0026gt;% pull(party)) The ggplot2 specification is then updated with the scale_fill_manual() layer:\n# ggplot2 spec. temp_party_shares_region %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(party, vote_share), y=vote_share)) + geom_col(aes(fill=party)) + scale_fill_manual(values=party_colours) + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~region) + labs( title=\u0026quot;Vote share by party in GB\u0026quot;, subtitle=\u0026quot;-- 2019 UK General Election\u0026quot;, caption=\u0026quot;Data published by House of Commons Library, accessed via `parlitools`\u0026quot;, x=\u0026quot;party\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;vote share\u0026quot; )+ theme_v_gds()   The idea behind visualization toolkits such as vega-lite, Tableau and ggplot2 is to insert visual data analysis approaches into the Data Scientist’s workflow. Rather than being overly concerned with low-level aspects of drawing, mapping to screen coordinates and scaling factors, the analyst instead focuses on aspects crucial to analysis – exposing patterns in the data by carefully specifying an encoding of data to visuals. Hadley Wickham talks about the type of workflow you will see used throughout this module – bits of dplyr to prepare data for charting before being piped (%\u0026gt;%) to a ggplot2 specification – as equivalent to a grammar of interactive graphics.\nThe process of searching for, defining and inserting manual colour schemes for creating Figure 14 might seem inimical to this. Indeed I was reluctant to include this code so early in the module – there is some reasonably advanced dplyr and a little regular expression in the data preparation code that I don’t want you to be overly concerned with. However, having control of these slightly more low-level properties is sometimes necessary even for supporting exploratory analysis, in this case for enabling a symbolisation that is clear and easily interpretable. Try relating the bars without our manual setting of colours by political party – it certainly requires some mental gymnastics.    Faceting by region   Plot relationships  Figure 15: Plots of 2019 versus 2017 vote shares.  In the Grammar of Graphics section we demonstrated how scatterplots are specified in ggplot2. Scatterplots are useful examples for introducing ggplot2 specifications as they involve working with genuine mark primitives (geom_point()) and can be built up using a wide range of encoding channels.\nTo continue the investigation of change in vote shares for the major parties between 2017 and 2019, Figure 15 contains scatterplots of vote share in 2019 (y-axis) against vote share in 2017 (x-axis) for Conservative and Labour. The graphics are annotated with a diagonal line. If constituencies voted in 2019 in exactly the same way as 2017, the points would all converge on the diagonal, points above the diagonal indicate a larger vote share than 2017, those below the diagonal represent a smaller vote share than 2017. Points are coloured according to the winning party in 2019 and constituencies that flipped from Labour to Conservative are emphasised using transparency and shape.\nThe code for generating most of the scatterplot comparing Conservative vote shares is below.\ndata_gb %\u0026gt;% mutate(winner_19=case_when( winner_19 == \u0026quot;Conservative\u0026quot; ~ \u0026quot;Conservative\u0026quot;, winner_19 == \u0026quot;Labour\u0026quot; ~ \u0026quot;Labour\u0026quot;, TRUE ~ \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot; )) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=con_17, y=con_19)) + geom_point(aes(colour=winner_19), alpha=.8) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) + scale_colour_manual(values=c(con,lab,other)) + ... Hopefully there is little surprising here:\nData: The data_gb data frame. Values of winner_19 that are not Conservative or Labour are recoded to Other using a conditional statement. This is because points are eventually coloured according to winning party, but the occlusion of points adds visual complexity and so I’ve chosen to prioritise the two main parties and recode remaining parties to other. Encoding: Conservative vote share in 2017 and 2019 are mapped to the x- and y- axes respectively and winner_19 to colour. scale_colour_manual() is used for customising the colours. Marks: geom_point() for generating the points of the scatterplot; geom_abline() for drawing the reference diagonal.    You will have encountered conditionals in the reading from last session. case_when allows you to avoid writing multiple if_else() statements. It wasn’t really necessary here – I could have used a single if_else with something like:\ndata_gb %\u0026gt;% mutate( winner_19=if_else(!winner_19 %in% c(\u0026quot;Conservative\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Labour\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;, winner_19) ) A general point from the code blocks in this session is of the importance of proficiency in dplyr. Throughout the module you will find yourself needing to calculate new variables, recode variables, and reorganise data frames before passing through to ggplot2.    Plot geography  Figure 16: Choropleth of elected parties in 2019 General Election.  In the graphics that facet by region, our analysis suggests at a geography to voting and certainly to observed changes in voting comparing the 2017 and 2019 elections (e.g. Figure 12). We end the session by encoding the results data with a spatial arrangement – we’ll generate some maps.\nTo do this we need to define a join on the boundary data (cons_outline):\n# Join constituency boundaries. data_gb \u0026lt;- cons_outline %\u0026gt;% inner_join(data_gb, by=c(\u0026quot;pcon19cd\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;ons_const_id\u0026quot;)) # Check class. ## [1] \u0026quot;sf\u0026quot; \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot; The code for generating the Choropleth maps of winning party by constituency in Figure 16:\n# Recode winner_19 as a factor variable for assigning colours. data_gb \u0026lt;- data_gb %\u0026gt;% mutate( winner_19=if_else(winner_19==\u0026quot;Speaker\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;, winner_19), winner_19=as_factor(winner_19)) # Create a named vector of colours party_colours \u0026lt;- c(con, lab, ld, green, other, snp, pc) names(party_colours) \u0026lt;- levels(data_gb %\u0026gt;% pull(winner_19)) # Plot map. data_gb %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(fill=winner_19)) + geom_sf(colour=\u0026quot;#eeeeee\u0026quot;, size=0.01)+ # Optionally add a layer for regional boundaries. # geom_sf(data=. %\u0026gt;% group_by(region) %\u0026gt;% summarise(), colour=\u0026quot;#eeeeee\u0026quot;, fill=\u0026quot;transparent\u0026quot;, size=0.08)+ coord_sf(crs=27700, datum=NA) + scale_fill_manual(values=party_colours) + A breakdown of the ggplot2 spec:\nData: The dplyr code updates data_gb by recoding winner_19 as a factor and defining a named vector of colours to supply to scale_fill_manual(). Encoding: No surprises here – fill according to winner_19. Marks: geom_sf() is a special class of geometry. It draws objects depending on the contents of the geometry column. In this case MULTIPOLYGON, so read this as a polygon geometric primitive. Coordinates: coord_sf – we set the coordinate system (CRS) explicitly. In this case OS British National Grid. More on this later in the module. Setting: Again, the theme_v_gds() theme. I’ve also subtly introduced light grey (colour=\"#eeeeee\") and thin (size=0.01) constituency boundaries to the geom_sf mark. On the map to the right outlines for regions are added as another geom_sf layer.   Figure 17: Map of Butler Con-Lab Swing in 2019 General Election.  This has been a packed session. I’m providing a very abbreviated introduction to map design with ggplot2 and want to reserve the details of how ggplot2 can be used in more involved visualization design for later in the module. Since the graphic has been discussed at length, it would be strange not to demonstrate how the encoding in the Washington Post piece can be applied here to analyse our Butler two-party swing variable (e.g. Beecham 2020).\nFirst, some helper functions – converting degrees to radians and centring geom_spoke() geometries. Don’t bother yourself with these details, just run the code.\n# Convert degrees to radians. get_radians \u0026lt;- function(degrees) { (degrees * pi) / (180) } # Rescaling function. map_scale \u0026lt;- function(value, min1, max1, min2, max2) { return (min2+(max2-min2)*((value-min1)/(max1-min1))) } # Position subclass for centred geom_spoke as per -- # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55474143/how-to-center-geom-spoke-around-their-origin position_center_spoke \u0026lt;- function() PositionCenterSpoke PositionCenterSpoke \u0026lt;- ggplot2::ggproto(\u0026#39;PositionCenterSpoke\u0026#39;, ggplot2::Position, compute_panel = function(self, data, params, scales) { data$x \u0026lt;- 2*data$x - data$xend data$y \u0026lt;- 2*data$y - data$yend data$radius \u0026lt;- 2*data$radius data } ) Next re-define party_colours, the object we use for manually setting colours, to contain just three values: hex codes for Conservative, Labour and Other.\nparty_colours \u0026lt;- c(con, lab, other) names(party_colours) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Conservative\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Labour\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;) And the ggplot2 specification:\nmax_shift \u0026lt;- max(abs(data_gb %\u0026gt;% pull(swing_con_lab))) min_shift \u0026lt;- -max_shift gb \u0026lt;- data_gb %\u0026gt;% mutate( is_flipped=seat_change_1719 %in% c(\u0026quot;Conservative gain from Labour\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Labour gain from Conservative\u0026quot;), elected=if_else(!winner_19 %in% c(\u0026quot;Conservative\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Labour\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;, as.character(winner_19)) ) %\u0026gt;% ggplot()+ geom_sf(aes(fill=elected), colour=\u0026quot;#636363\u0026quot;, alpha=.2, size=.01)+ geom_spoke( aes(x=bng_e, y=bng_n, angle=get_radians(map_scale(swing_con_lab,min_shift,max_shift,135,45)), colour=elected, size=is_flipped), radius=7000, position=\u0026quot;center_spoke\u0026quot; )+ coord_sf(crs=27700, datum=NA)+ scale_size_ordinal(range=c(.3,.9))+ scale_colour_manual(values=party_colours)+ scale_fill_manual(values=party_colours)+ theme_v_gds() A breakdown:\nData: data_gb is updated with a boolean identifying whether or not the Constituency flipped Con-Lab/Lab-Con between successive elections (is_flipped), and a variable simplifying the party elected to either Conservative, Labour or Other. Encoding: geom_sf is again filled by elected party. This encoding is made more subtle by adding transparency (alpha=.2). geom_spoke() is a line primitive that can be encoded with a location and direction. It is mapped to the geographic centroid of each Constituency (bng_e - easting, bng_n - northing), coloured according to elected party, sized according to whether the Constituency flipped its vote and tilted according to the Swing variable. Here I’ve created a function (map_scale) which pegs the maximum Swing values in either direction to 45 degrees (max Swing to the right, Conservative) and 135 degrees (max Swing to the left, Labour). Marks: geom_sf() for the Constituency boundaries, geom_spoke() for the angled line primitives. Scale: geom_spoke() primitives are sized to emphasise whether constituencies have flipped. The size encoding is censored to two values with scale_size_ordinal(). Passed to scale_colour_manual() and scale_fill_manual() is the vector of party_colours Coordinates: coord_sf – the CRS is OS British National Grid. Setting: The radius, the of geom_spoke() primitives is a sensible default arrived at through trial and error, its position set using our center_spoke class.    Conclusions Visualization design is ultimately a process of decision-making. Data must be filtered and prioritised before being encoded with marks, visual channels and symbolisation. The most successful data graphics are those that expose structure, connections and comparisons that could not be achieved easily via other, non-visual means. This session has introduced concepts – a vocabulary, framework and empirically-informed guidelines – that helps support this decision-making process and that underpins modern visualization toolkits (ggplot2 included).

Introduction This session covers some of the basics around how to describe and organise data. Whilst this might sound prosaic, there are several reasons why being able to consistently describe a dataset is important. First: it is the initial step in any analysis and helps delimit the research themes and technical procedures that can be deployed. This is especially relevant to modern Data Science-type workflows (like those supported by tidyverse), where it is common apply the same analysis templates for working over data. Describing your dataset with a consistent vocabulary enables you to identify which analysis templates to reuse. Second relates to the point in Session 1 that Geographic Data Science projects usually involve repurposing datasets for social science research for the first time. It is often not obvious whether the data contain sufficient detail and structure to characterise the target behaviours to be researched and the target populations they are assumed to represent. This leads to additional levels of uncertainty and places greater importance on the initial step of data processing, description and exploration.\nThrough the session we will learn both language and concepts for describing and thinking about data, but also how to deploy some of the most important data processing and organisation techniques in R to wrangle over a real dataset. We will be working throughout with data from New York’s Citibike scheme, accessed through the bikedata package, an API to Citibike’s publicly available origin-destination trip data.\n  The idea of applying a consistent vocabulary to describing your data applies especially to working with modern visualization toolkits (ggplot2, Tableau, vega-lite), and will be covered in some detail during the next session as we introduce Visualization Fundamentals and the Grammar of Graphics.    Concepts Data structure In the module we will work with data frames in R. These are spreadsheet like representations where rows are observations (case/record) and columns are variables. Each variable (column) in a data frame is a vector that must be of equal length. Where observations have missing values for certain variables, therefore where they may violate this equal-length requirement, the missing values must be substituted with something, usually with NA or similar. This constraint occasionally causes difficulties, for example when working with variables that contain values of different length for an observation. In these cases we create a special class of column, a list-column, something we’ll return to later in the module.\nOrganising data according this simple structure – rows as observations, columns as variables – makes working with data more straightforward. A specific set of tools, made available via the tidyverse, can be deployed for doing most data tidying tasks (Wickham 2014).\n Types of variable   Table 1: A breakdown of Stevens (1946) variable types, operators and measures of central tendency that can be applied to each.    Measurement  Description  Example  Operators  Midpoint  Dispersion     Categories    Nominal  Non-orderable categories  Political parties; street names  = ≠  mode  entropy    Ordinal  Orderable categories  Terrorism threat levels  … | \u0026lt;\u0026gt;  … | median  … | percentile   Measures    Interval  Numeric measurements  Temperatures; years  … | + -  … | mean  … | variance    Ratio  … | Counts  Distances; prices  … | × ÷  … | mean  … | variance     A classification you may have encountered for describing variables is that developed by Stevens (1946), which considers the level of measurement of a variable. Stevens (1946) classed variables into two groups: variables that describe categories of things and variables that describe measurements of things. Categories include attributes like gender, titles, Subscribers or Casual users of a bikeshare scheme and ranked orders (1st, 2nd, 3rd largest etc.). Measurements include quantities like distance, age, travel time, number of journeys made on a bikeshare scheme.\nCategories can be further subdivided into those that are unordered (nominal) from those that are ordered (ordinal). Measurements can also be subdivided. Interval measurements are quantities that can be ordered and where the difference between two values is meaningful. Ratio measurements have both these properties, but also have a meaningful 0 – where 0 means the absence of something – and where the ratio of two values can be computed. The most common cited example of an interval measurement is temperature (in degrees C). Temperatures can be ordered and compared additively, but 0 degrees C does not mean the absence of temperature and 20 degrees C is not twice as “hot” as 10 degrees C. Add Cyclic ratio (measures bound to range – circle, clock time)\nWhy is this important? The measurement level of a variable determines the types of data analysis procedures that can be performed and therefore allows us to efficiently make decisions when working with a dataset for the first time (Table 1).\n Types of observation Observations either together form an entire population or a subset, or sample that we expect represents a target population.\nYou no doubt will be familiar with these concepts, but we have to think a little more about this in Geographic Data Science applications as we may often be working with datasets that are so-called population-level. The Citibike dataset is a complete, population-level dataset in that every journey made through the scheme is recorded. Whether or not this is truly a population-level dataset, however, depends on the analysis purpose. When analysing the bikeshare dataset are we interested only in describing use within the Citibike scheme or are we taking the patterns observed through our analysis to make claims and inferences about cycling more generally?\nIf the latter, then there are problems as the level of detail we have on our sample is pretty trivial compared to traditional datasets, where we deliberately design data collection activities with a specified target population in mind. It may therefore be difficult to gauge how representative Citibike users and Citibike cycling is of New York’s general cycling population. The flipside is that passively collected data do not suffer from the same problems such as non-response bias and social-desirability bias as traditionally collected datasets.\n Tidy data I mentioned that we would be working with data frames organised such that columns always and only refer to variables and rows always and only refer to observations. This arrangement, called tidy (Wickham 2014), has two key advantages. First, if data are arranged in a consistent way, then it is easier to apply and re-use tools for wrangling them due to data having the same underlying structure. Second, placing variables into columns, with each column containing a vector of values, means that we can take advantage of R’s vectorised functions for transforming data – we will demonstrate this in the technical element of this session.\nThe three rules for tidy data:\nEach variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table.  Drug treatment dataset To elaborate further, we can use the example given in Wickham (2014), a drug treatment dataset in which two different treatments were administered to participants.\nThe data could be represented as:\n  Table 2: Table 1 of Wickham (2014).    person  treatment_a  treatment_b      John Smith  –  2    Jane Doe  16  11    Mary Johnson  3  1     An alternative organisation could be:\n  Table 3: Alternative organisation of Table 1 of Wickham (2014).    treatment  John Smith  Jane Doe  Mary Johnson      treatment_a  –  16  3    treatment_b  2  11  1     Both present the same information unambiguously – Table 3 is simply Table 2 transposed. However, neither is tidy as the observations are spread across both the rows and columns. This means that we need to apply different procedures to extract, perform computations on, and visually represent, these data.\nMuch better would be to organise the table into a tidy form. To do this we need to identify the variables:\nperson: a categorical nominal variable which takes three values: John Smith, Jane Doe, Mary Johnson. treatment: a categorical nominal variable which takes values: a and b. result: a measurement ratio (I think) variable which six recorded values (including the missing value): -, 16, 3, 2, 11,  Each observation is then a test result returned for each combination of person and treatment.\nSo, a tidy organisation for this dataset would be:\n  Table 4: Tidy version of Table 1 of Wickham (2014).    person  treatment  result      John Smith  a  –    John Smith  b  2    Jane Doe  a  16    Jane Doe  b  11    Mary Johnson  a  3    Mary Johnson  b  1      Gapminder population dataset In chapter 12 of Wickham and Grolemund (2017), the benefits of this layout, particularly for working with R, are demonstrated with the canonical gapminder dataset. I recommend reading this short chapter in full. We will be applying similar approaches in the technique part of this class (which follows shortly) and also the homework. To consolidate our conceptual understanding of tidy data let’s quickly look at the gapminder data, as it is a dataset we’re probably more likely to encounter.\nFirst, a tidy version of the data:\n  Table 5: Tidy excerpt of gapminder dataset.    country  year  cases  population      Afghanistan  1999  745  19987071    Afghanistan  2000  2666  20595360    Brazil  1999  37737  172006362    Brazil  2000  80488  174504898    China  1999  212258  1272915272    China  2000  213766  1280428583     So the variables:\ncountry: a categorical nominal variable. year: a date (cyclic ratio) variable. cases: a ratio (count) variable. population: a ratio (count) variable.  Each observation is therefore a recorded count of cases and population for a country in a year.\nAn alternative organisation of this dataset that appears in Wickham and Grolemund (2017) is below. This is untidy as the observations are spread across two rows. This makes operations that we might want to perform on the cases and population variables – for example computing exposure rates – somewhat tedious.\n  Table 6: Untidy excerpt of gapminder dataset: observations spread across rows    country  year  type  count      Afghanistan  1999  cases  745    Afghanistan  1999  population  19987071    Afghanistan  2000  cases  2666    Afghanistan  2000  population  20595360    Brazil  1999  cases  37737    Brazil  1999  population  174504898    …  …  …  …     This actually doesn’t appear in Wickham and Grolemund (2017), but imagine that the gapminder dataset instead reported values of cases separately by gender. A type of representation I’ve often seen in social sciences, probably as it is helpful for data entry, is where observations are spread across the columns. This too creates problems for performing aggregate functions, but also for specifying visualization designs (in ggplot2) as we will discover in the next session.\n  Table 7: Untidy possible excerpt of gapminder dataset: observations spread across columns    country  year  f_cases  m_cases  f_population  m_population      Afghanistan  1999  447  298  9993400  9993671    Afghanistan  2000  1599  1067  10296280  10299080    Brazil  1999  16982  20755  86001181  86005181    Brazil  2000  39440  41048  87251329  87253569    China  1999  104007  108252  636451250  636464022    China  2000  104746  109759  640212600  640215983        Techniques The technical element to this session involves importing, describing, transforming and tidying data from a large bikeshare scheme – New York’s Citibike scheme.\n Download the  02-template.Rmd file for this session and save it to the reports folder of your vis-for-gds project that you created in session 1. Open your vis-for-gds project in RStudio and load the template file by clicking File \u0026gt; Open File ... \u0026gt; reports/02-template.Rmd.  Import In the template file there is a discussion of how to setup your R session with key packages – tidyverse , fst, lubridate, sf – and also the bikedata package for accessing bikeshare data.\nAvailable via the bikedata package are trip and occupancy data for a number of bikeshare schemes (as below). We will work with data from New York’s Citibike scheme for June 2020. A list of all cities covered by the bikedata package is below:\nbike_cities() ## city city_name bike_system ## 1 bo Boston Hubway ## 2 ch Chicago Divvy ## 3 dc Washington DC CapitalBikeShare ## 4 gu Guadalajara mibici ## 5 la Los Angeles Metro ## 6 lo London Santander ## 7 mo Montreal Bixi ## 8 mn Minneapolis NiceRide ## 9 ny New York Citibike ## 10 ph Philadelphia Indego ## 11 sf Bay Area FordGoBike In the template there are code chunks demonstrating how to download and process these data using bikedata’s API. This is mainly for illustrative purposes and the code chunks take some time to execute. We ultimately use the fst package for serializing and reading in the these data. So I suggest you ignore the import code and calls to the bikedata API and instead follow the instructions for downloading and reading in the .fst file with the trips data and also the .csv  file containing stations data, with:\n# Create subdirectory in data folder for storing bike data. if(!dir.exists(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bikedata\u0026quot;))) dir.create(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bikedata\u0026quot;)) # Read in .csv file of stations data from url. tmp_file \u0026lt;- tempfile() url \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;https://www.roger-beecham.com/datasets/ny_stations.csv\u0026quot; curl::curl_download(url, tmp_file, mode=\u0026quot;wb\u0026quot;) ny_stations \u0026lt;- read_csv(tmp_file) # Read in .fst file of trips data from url. tmp_file \u0026lt;- tempfile() cs_url \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;https://www.roger-beecham.com/datasets/ny_trips.fst\u0026quot; curl::curl_download(url, tmp_file, mode=\u0026quot;wb\u0026quot;) ny_trips \u0026lt;- read_fst(tmp_file) # Write out to subdirectory for future use. write_fst(trips, here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny_trips.fst\u0026quot;)) write_csv(stations, here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny_stations.csv\u0026quot;)) # Clean workspace. rm(url, tmp_file)   fst implements in the background various operations such as multi-threading to reduce load on disk space. It therefore makes it possible to work with large datasets in-memory in R rather than connecting to a database and serving up summaries/subsets to be loaded into R. We will be working with just 2 million records, but with fst it is possible to work in-memory with much larger datasets – in Lovelace (2020) we ended up working with 80 million + trip records.   If you completed the reading and research from the Session 1 Homework, some of the above should be familiar to you. The key arguments to look at are read_csv() and read_fst(), into which we pass the path to the file. In this case we created a tmpfile() within the R session. We then write these data out and save locally to the project’s data folder. This is useful as we only want to download the data once. In the write_*\u0026lt;\u0026gt; functions we reference this location using the here package’s here() function. here is really useful for reliably creating paths relative to your project’s root. To read in these data for future sessions:\n# Read in these local copies of the trips and stations data. ny_trips \u0026lt;- read_fst(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny_trips.fst\u0026quot;)) ny_stations \u0026lt;- read_csv(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny_stations.csv\u0026quot;)) Notice that we use assignment here (\u0026lt;-) so that these data are loaded as objects and appear in the Environment pane of your RStudio window. An efficient description of data import with read_csv() is also in Chapter 11 of Wickham and Grolemund (2017).\nny_stations and ny_trips are data frames, spreadsheet type representations containing observations in rows and variables in columns. Inspecting the layout of the stations data with View(ny_stations) you will notice that the top line is the header and contains column (variable) names.  Figure 1: ny_trips and ny_stations as they appear when calling View().   Describe There are several functions for generating a quick overview of a data frame’s contents. glimpse\u0026lt;dataset-name\u0026gt; is particularly useful. It provides a summary of the data frame dimensions – we have c. 1.9 million trip observations in ny_trips and 11 variables. The function also prints out the object type for each of these variables, with the variables either of type int or chr in this case.\nglimpse(ny_trips) ## Rows: 1,882,273 ## Columns: 11 ## $ id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21… ## $ city \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;… ## $ trip_duration \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1062, 3810, 1017, 226, 1437, 355, 99, 1810, 87, 2714, 2096, 1611, 529, 69… ## $ start_time \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;2020-06-01 00:00:03\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2020-06-01 00:00:03\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2020-06-01 00:00:09\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;202… ## $ stop_time \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;2020-06-01 00:17:46\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2020-06-01 01:03:33\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2020-06-01 00:17:06\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;202… ## $ start_station_id \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;ny3419\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny366\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny389\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny3255\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny367\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny248\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny3232\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny3263… ## $ end_station_id \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;ny3419\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny336\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny3562\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny505\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny497\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny247\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny390\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny496\u0026quot;,… ## $ bike_id \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;39852\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;37558\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;37512\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;39674\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;21093\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;39594\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;43315\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;16571\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;… ## $ user_type \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Subscriber\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Subscriber… ## $ birth_year \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;1997\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1969\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1988\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1969\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1997\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1990\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1938\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1995\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1971\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;… ## $ gender \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… glimpse(ny_stations) ## Rows: 1,010 ## Columns: 6 ## $ id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 2… ## $ city \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;n… ## $ stn_id \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;ny116\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny119\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny120\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny127\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny128\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny143\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny144\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny146\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ny150\u0026quot;,… ## $ name \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;W 17 St \u0026amp; 8 Ave\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Park Ave \u0026amp; St Edwards St\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Lexington Ave \u0026amp; Classon Ave\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B… ## $ longitude \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;-74.00149746\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-73.97803415\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-73.95928168\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-74.00674436\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-74.00297088\u0026quot;, … ## $ latitude \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;40.74177603\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;40.69608941\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;40.68676793\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;40.73172428\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;40.72710258\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;40.6…   Table 8: A breakdown of data types in R.    Type  Description      lgl  Logical – vectors that can contain only TRUE or FALSE values    int  Integers – whole numbers    dbl  Double – real numbers with decimals    chr  Character – text strings    dttm  Date-times – a date + a time    fctr  Factors – represent categorical variables of fixed and potentially orderable values     The object type of a variable in a data frane relates to that variable’s measurement level. It is often useful to convert to types with greater specificity. For example, we may which to convert the start_time and stop_time variables to a date-time format so that various time-related functions could be used. For efficient storage, we may wish to convert the station identifier variables as int types by removing the redundant “ny” text which prefaces end_station_id, end_station_id, stn_id. The geographic coordinates are currently stored as type chr. These could be regarded as quantitative variables, floating points with decimals. So converting to type dbl or as a POINT geometry type (more on this later in the module) may be sensible.\nIn the  02-template.Rmd file there are code chunks for doing these conversions. There are some slightly more involved data transform procedures in this code. Don’t fixate too much on these, but the upshot can be seen when running glimpse() on the converted data frames:\nglimpse(ny_trips) ## Rows: 1,882,273 ## Columns: 10 ## $ id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 2… ## $ trip_duration \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1062, 3810, 1017, 226, 1437, 355, 99, 1810, 87, 2714, 2096, 1611, 529, 695, 206,… ## $ start_time \u0026lt;dttm\u0026gt; 2020-06-01 00:00:03, 2020-06-01 00:00:03, 2020-06-01 00:00:09, 2020-06-01 00:00… ## $ stop_time \u0026lt;dttm\u0026gt; 2020-06-01 00:00:03, 2020-06-01 00:00:03, 2020-06-01 00:00:09, 2020-06-01 00:00… ## $ start_station_id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 3419, 366, 389, 3255, 367, 248, 3232, 3263, 390, 319, 237, 3630, 3610, 3708, 465… ## $ end_station_id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 3419, 336, 3562, 505, 497, 247, 390, 496, 3232, 455, 3263, 3630, 3523, 3740, 379… ## $ bike_id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 39852, 37558, 37512, 39674, 21093, 39594, 43315, 16571, 28205, 41760, 30745, 380… ## $ user_type \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Subscriber\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Customer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Subscriber\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Sub… ## $ birth_year \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1997, 1969, 1988, 1969, 1997, 1990, 1938, 1995, 1971, 1989, 1990, 1969, 1984, 19… ## $ gender \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;female\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;female\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;female\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;male\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;female\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;female\u0026quot;, … glimpse(ny_stations) ## Rows: 1,010 ## Columns: 5 ## $ id \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, … ## $ stn_id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 116, 119, 120, 127, 128, 143, 144, 146, 150, 151, 157, 161, 164, 167, 168, 173, 174, 19… ## $ name \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;W 17 St \u0026amp; 8 Ave\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Park Ave \u0026amp; St Edwards St\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Lexington Ave \u0026amp; Classon Ave\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Barrow S… ## $ longitude \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; -74.00150, -73.97803, -73.95928, -74.00674, -74.00297, -73.99338, -73.98069, -74.00911,… ## $ latitude \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 40.74178, 40.69609, 40.68677, 40.73172, 40.72710, 40.69240, 40.69840, 40.71625, 40.7208…  Transform Transform with dplyr   Table 9: dplyr funcitions (verbs) for manipulating data frames.    function()  Description      filter()  Picks rows (observations) if their values match a specified criteria    arrange()  Reorders rows (observations) based on their values    select()  Picks a subset of columns (variables) by name (or name characteristics)    rename()  Changes the name of columns in the data frame    mutate()  Adds new columns (or variables)    group_by()  Chunks the dataset into groups for grouped operations    summarise()  Calculate single-row (non-grouped) or multiple-row (if grouped) summary values    ..and more      dplyr is one of the most important packages for supporting modern data analysis workflows. The package provides a grammar of data manipulation, with access to functions that can be variously combined to support most data processing and transformation activity. Once you become familiar with dplyr functions (or verbs) you will find yourself generating analysis templates to re-use whenever you work on a new dataset.\nAll dplyr functions work in the same way:\nStart with a data frame. Pass some arguments to the function which control what you do to the data frame. Return the updated data frame.  So every dplyr function expects a data frame and will always return a data frame.\n Use pipes %\u0026gt;% with dplyr dplyr is most effective when its functions are chained together – you will see this shortly as we explore the New York bikeshare data. This chaining of functions can be achieved using the pipe operator (%\u0026gt;%). Pipes are used for passing information in a program. They take the output of a set of code (a dplyr specification) and make it the input of the next set (another dplyr specification).\nPipes can be easily applied to dplyr functions, and the functions of all packages that form the tidyverse. I mentioned in Session 1 that ggplot2 provides a framework for specifying a layered grammar of graphics (more on this in Session 3). Together with the pipe operator (%\u0026gt;%), dplyr supports a layered grammar of data manipulation.\n count() rows This might sound a little abstract so let’s use and combine some dplyr functions to generate some statistical summaries on the New York bikeshare data.\nFirst we’ll count the number of trips made in Jun 2020 by gender. dplyr has a convenience function for counting, so we could run the code below, also in the  02-template.Rmd for this session. I’ve commented the code block to convey what each line achieves.\nny_trips %\u0026gt;% # Take the ny_trips data frame. count(gender, sort=TRUE) # Run the count function over the data frame and set the sort parameter to TRUE. ## gender n ## 1 male 1044621 ## 2 female 586361 ## 3 unknown 251291 There are a few things happening in the count() function. It takes the gender variable from ny_trips, organises or groups the rows in the data frame according to its values (female | male | unknown), counts the rows and then orders the summarised output descending on the counts.\n summarise() over rows   Table 10: A breakdown of aggregate functions commonly used with summarise().    Function  Description      n()  Counts the number of observations    n_distinct(var)  Counts the number of unique observations    sum(var)  Sums the values of observations    max(var)|min(var)  Finds the min|max values of observations    mean(var)|median(var)|sd(var)| ...  Calculates central tendency of observations    ...  Many more     Often you will want to do more than simply counting and you may also want to be more explicit in the way the data frame is grouped for computation. We’ll demonstrate this here with a more involved analysis of the usage data and using some key aggregate functions (Table 10).\nA common workflow is to combine group_by() and summarise(), and in this case arrange() to replicate the count() example.\nny_trips %\u0026gt;% # Take the ny_trips data frame. group_by(gender) %\u0026gt;% # Group by gender. summarise(count=n()) %\u0026gt;% # Count the number of observations per group. arrange(desc(count)) # Arrange the grouped and summarised (collapsed) rows according to count. ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## gender count ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 male 1044621 ## 2 female 586361 ## 3 unknown 251291 In ny_trips there is a variable measuring trip duration in seconds (trip_duration) and distinguishing casual users from those formally registered to use the scheme (user_type - Customer vs. Subscriber). It may be instructive to calculate some summary statistics to see how trip duration varies between these groups.\nThe code below uses group_by(), summarise() and arrange() in exactly the same way, but with the addition of other aggregate functions profiles the trip_duration variable according to central tendency and by user_type.\nny_trips %\u0026gt;% # Take the ny_trips data frame. group_by(user_type) %\u0026gt;% # Group by user type. summarise( # Summarise over the grouped rows, generate a new variable for each type of summary. count=n(), avg_duration=mean(trip_duration/60), median_duration=median(trip_duration/60), sd_duration=sd(trip_duration/60), min_duration=min(trip_duration/60), max_duration=min(trip_duration/60) ) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(count)) # Arrange on the count variable. ## # A tibble: 2 x 6 ## user_type count avg_duration median_duration sd_duration min_duration max_duration ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Subscriber 1306688 20.2 14.4 110. 1.02 1.02 ## 2 Customer 575585 43.6 23.2 393. 1.02 1.02 Clearly there are some outlier trips that may need to be examined. Bikeshare schemes are built to incentivise short journeys of \u0026lt;30 minutes. However, the max trip duration made by a Subscriber was almost 2 hours and a Customer 6.5 hours. These may be legitimate trips rather than errors in the data – the durations are not in the order of months or years. It also makes sense that more casual users may have longer trip durations, as they are more likely to be tourists or occasional cyclists using the scheme for non-utility trips. However, they do skew the mean travel time.\nReturning to the breakdown of usage by gender, an interesting question is whether or not the male-female split in bikehare is similar to that of the cycling population of New York City as a whole. This might tell us something about whether the bikeshare scheme could be representative of wider cycling. This could be achieved with the code below. A couple of new additions: we use filter(), to remove observations where the gender of the cyclist is unknown. We also use mutate() for the first time, which allows us to modify or create new variables.\nny_trips %\u0026gt;% # Take the ny_trips data frame. filter(gender != \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # Filter out rows with the value \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot; on gender. group_by(gender) %\u0026gt;% # Group by gender. summarise(count=n()) %\u0026gt;% # Count the number of observations per group. mutate(prop=count/sum(count)) %\u0026gt;% # Add a new column called `prop`, divide the value in the row for the variable count by the sum of the count variable across all rows. arrange(desc(count)) # Arrange on the count variable. ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## gender count prop ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 male 1044621 0.640 ## 2 female 586361 0.360 As I’ve commented each line you hopefully get a sense of what is happening in the code above. I mentioned that dplyr functions read like verbs. This is a very deliberate design decision. With the code laid out as above – each dplyr verb occupying a single line, separated by a pipe (%\u0026gt;%) – you can generally understand the code with a cursory glance. There are obvious benefits to this. Once you become familiar with dplyr it becomes very easy to read, write and share code.\n  Remembering that pipes (%\u0026gt;%) take the output of a set of code and make it the input of the next set, what do you think would happen if you were to comment out the call to arrange() in the code block above? Try it for yourself. You will notice that I use separate lines for each call to the pipe operator. This is good practice for supporting readibility of your code.    Manipulate dates with lubridate Let’s continue this investigation of usage by gender, and whether bikeshare might be representative of regular cycling, by profiling how usage varies over time. To do this we will need to work with date-time variables. The lubridate package provides various convenience functions for this.\nIn the code block below we extract the day of week and hour of day from the start_time variable using lubridate’s day accessor functions. Documentation on these can be accessed in the usual way (?\u0026lt;function-name\u0026gt;), but reading down the code it should be clear to you how this works. Next we count the number of trips made by hour of day, day of week and gender. The summarised data frame will be re-used several times in our analysis, so we store it as an object with a suitable name (ny_temporal) using the assignment operator.\n# Create a hod dow summary by gender and assign it the name \u0026quot;ny_temporal\u0026quot;. ny_temporal \u0026lt;- ny_trips %\u0026gt;% # Take the ny_trips data frame. mutate( day=wday(start_time, label=TRUE), # Create a new column identify dow. hour=hour(start_time)) %\u0026gt;% # Create a new column identify hod. group_by(gender, day, hour) %\u0026gt;% # Group by day, hour, gender. summarise(count=n()) %\u0026gt;% # Count the grouped rows. ungroup()   Whether or not to store derived data tables like ny_temporal in a session is not an easy decision. You want to try to avoid cluttering your Environment pane with many data objects. Often when generating charts it is necessary to create these sorts of derived tables as input data (to ggplot2) – and so when doing visual data analysis you may end up with an unhelpfully large number of these derived tables. The general rule I apply: if the derived table is to be used \u0026gt;3 times in a data analysis or is computationally intensive, assign it to an object.   In Figure 2 below these derived data are plotted. The template contains ggplot2 code for creating the graphic. Don’t obsess too much on it – more on this next session. The plot demonstrates a familiar weekday-weekend pattern of usage. Trip frequencies peak in the morning and evening rush hours during weekdays and mid/late-morning and afternoon during weekends. This is consistent with typical travel behaviour. Notice though that the weekday afternoon peak is much larger than the morning peak. There are several speculative explanations for this and re-running the plot on Subscriber users only may be instructive. A secondary observation is that whilst men and women share this overall pattern of usage, the relative number of trips taken by each day of week varies. Men make many more trips at peak times during the start of the week than they do later in the week. The same pattern does not appear for women. This is certainly something to follow up on, for example by collecting data over a longer period of time.\n Figure 2: Line charts generated with ggplot2. Plot data computed using dplyr and lubridate.    Our analysis is based on data from June 2020, a time when New York residents were emerging from lockdown. It would be instructive to compare with data from a non-Covid year. If there is a very clear contrast in usage between this data and a control (non-Covid) year, this suggests bikeshare data may be used for monitoring behavioural change. The fact that bikeshare is collected continuously makes this possible. Check out Jo Wood’s current work analysing Covid-related change in movement behaviours across a range of cities.    Relate tables with join() Trip distance is not recorded directly in the ny_trips table, but may be important for profiling usage behaviour. Calculating trip distance is eminently achievable as the ny_trips table contains the origin and destination station of every trip and the ny_stations table contains coordinates corresponding to those stations. To relate the two tables, we need to specify a join between them.\nA sensible approach is to:\nSelect all uniquely cycled trip pairs (origin-destination pairs) that appear in the ny_trips table. Bring in the corresponding coordinate pairs representing the origin and destination stations by joining on the ny_stations table. Calculate the distance between the coordinate pairs representing the origin and destination.  The code below is one way of achieving this.\nod_pairs \u0026lt;- ny_trips %\u0026gt;% # Take the ny_trips data frame. select(start_station_id, end_station_id) %\u0026gt;% unique() %\u0026gt;% # Select trip origin and destination (OD) station columns and extract unique OD pairs. left_join(ny_stations %\u0026gt;% select(stn_id, longitude, latitude), by=c(\u0026quot;start_station_id\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;stn_id\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% # Select lat, lon columns from ny_stations and join on the origin column. rename(o_lon=longitude, o_lat=latitude) %\u0026gt;% # Rename new lat, lon columns -- associate with origin station. left_join(ny_stations %\u0026gt;% select(stn_id, longitude, latitude), by=c(\u0026quot;end_station_id\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;stn_id\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% # Select lat, lon columns from ny_stations and join on the destination column. rename(d_lon=longitude, d_lat=latitude) %\u0026gt;% # Rename new lat, lon columns -- associate with destination station. rowwise() %\u0026gt;% # For computing distance calculation one row-at-a-time. mutate(dist=geosphere::distHaversine(c(o_lat, o_lon), c(d_lat, d_lon))/1000) %\u0026gt;% # Calculate distance and express in kms. ungroup() The code block above introduces some new functions: select() to pick or drop variables, rename() to rename variables and a convenience function for calculating straight line distance from polar coordinates (distHaversine()). The key function to emphasise is the left_join(). If you’ve worked with relational databases and SQL, dplyr’s join functions will be familiar to you. In a left_join, all the values from the main table are retained, the one on the left – ny_trips, and variables from the table on the right (ny_stations) are added. We specify explicitly the variable on which the tables should be joined with the by= parameter, station_id in this case. If there is a station_id in ny_trips that doesn’t exist in ny_stations then NA is returned.\nOther join functions provided by dplyr are in the table below. Rather than discussing each, I recommend consulting Chapter 13 of Wickham and Grolemund (2017).\n   *_join(x, y) ...       Table 11: A breakdown of dplyr join functions.    left_join()  all rows from x    right_join()  all rows from y    full_join()  all rows from both x and y    semi_join()  all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x    inner_join()  all rows from x where there are matching values in y, return all combination of multiple matches in the case of multiple matches    anti_join  return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, never duplicate rows of x      Figure 3: Histograms generated with ggplot2. Plot data computed using dplyr and lubridate  From the newly created distance variable, we can calculate the average (mean) trip distance for the 1.9m trips – 1.6km. This might seem very short, but remember that the distance calculation is problematic in that these are straight-line distances between pairs of docking stations. Really we should be calculating network distances derived from the cycle network in New York. A separate reason – discovered when generating a histogram on the dist variable – is that there are a large number of trips (124,403) that start and end at the same docking station. Initially these might seem to be unsuccessful hires – people failing to undock a bike for example. We could investigate this further by paying attention to the docking stations at which same origin-destination trips occur, as in the code block below.\nny_trips %\u0026gt;% filter(start_station_id==end_station_id) %\u0026gt;% group_by(start_station_id) %\u0026gt;% summarise(count=n()) %\u0026gt;% left_join(ny_stations %\u0026gt;% select(stn_id, name), by=c(\u0026quot;start_station_id\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;stn_id\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(count)) ## # A tibble: 958 x 3 ## start_station_id count name ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 ny3423 2017 West Drive \u0026amp; Prospect Park West ## 2 ny3881 1263 12 Ave \u0026amp; W 125 St ## 3 ny514 1024 12 Ave \u0026amp; W 40 St ## 4 ny3349 978 Grand Army Plaza \u0026amp; Plaza St West ## 5 ny3992 964 W 169 St \u0026amp; Fort Washington Ave ## 6 ny3374 860 Central Park North \u0026amp; Adam Clayton Powell Blvd ## 7 ny3782 837 Brooklyn Bridge Park - Pier 2 ## 8 ny3599 829 Franklin Ave \u0026amp; Empire Blvd ## 9 ny3521 793 Lenox Ave \u0026amp; W 111 St ## 10 ny2006 782 Central Park S \u0026amp; 6 Ave ## # … with 948 more rows All of the top 10 docking stations are either in parks, near parks or located along river promenades. This coupled with the fact that these trips occur in much greater relative number for casual than regular users (Customer vs Subscriber) is further evidence that these are valid trips.\n Write functions of your own Through most of the module we will be making use of functions written by others – mainly those developed for packages that form the tidyverse and therefore that follow a consistent syntax. However, there may be times where you need abstract over some of your code to make functions of your own. Chapter 19 of Wickham and Grolemund (2017) presents some helpful guidelines around the circumstances under which the data scientist typically tends to write functions. Most often this is when you find yourself copy and pasting the same chunks of code with minimal adaptation.\nFunctions have three key characteristics:\nThey are (usually) named – the name should be expressive and communicate what the function does (we talk about dplyr verbs). They have brackets \u0026lt;function()\u0026gt; usually containing arguments – inputs which determine what the function does and returns. Immediately followed by \u0026lt;function()\u0026gt; are` used to contain the body – in this is code that performs a distinct task, described by the function’s name.  Effective functions are short, perform single discrete operations and are intuitive.\nYou will recall that in the ny_trips table there a variable called birth_year. From this we can derive cyclists’ approximate age. Below I have written a function get_age() for doing this. The function expects two arguments: yob – a year of birth as type chr; yref – a reference year. In the body, lubridate’s as.period function is used to calculate the time in years that elapsed, the value that the function returns. Once defined, and loaded into the session by being executed, it can be used (as below).\n# Function for calculating time elapsed between two dates in years (age). get_age \u0026lt;- function(yob, yref) { period \u0026lt;- lubridate::as.period(lubridate::interval(yob, yref),unit = \u0026quot;year\u0026quot;) return(period$year) } ny_trips \u0026lt;- ny_trips %\u0026gt;% # Take the ny_trips data frame. mutate( age=get_age(as.POSIXct(birth_year, format=\u0026quot;%Y\u0026quot;), as.POSIXct(\u0026quot;2020\u0026quot;, format=\u0026quot;%Y\u0026quot;)) # Calculate age from birth_date. ) We can use the two new derived variables – distance travelled and age – in our analysis. In Figure 4, we explore how approximate travel speeds vary by age, gender and trip distance. The code used to generate the summary data and plot is in the template file. Again the average “speed” calculation should be treated very cautiously as it is based on straight line distances and it is very difficult to select out “utility” from “leisure” trips. I have tried to do the latter by selecting trips that occur only on weekdays and that are made by Subscriber cyclists. Additionally, due to the heavy subsetting data become a little volatile for certain age groups and so I’ve aggregated the age variable into 5-year bands. Collecting more data is probably a good idea. Still there are some interesting patterns. Men tend to cycle at faster speeds than do women, although this gap narrows with the older age groups. The effect of age on speed cycled is more apparent for the longer trips. This trend is reasonably strong, although the volatility in the older age groups for trips \u0026gt;4.5km suggests we probably need more data and a more involved analysis to establish this. For example, it may be that the comparatively rare occurrence of trips in the 65-70 age group is made by only a small subset of cyclists. A larger dataset would result in a regression to the mean effect and negate any noise caused by outlier individuals.\n Figure 4: Line charts generated with ggplot2. Plot data computed using dplyr and lubridate    Tidy The ny_trips and ny_stations data already comply with the rules for tidy data (Wickham 2014). Each row in ny_trips is a distinct trip and each row in ny_stations a distinct station. However throughout the module we will undoubtedly encounter datasets that need to be reshaped. There are two key functions to learn here, made available via the tidyr package: pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(). pivot_longer is used to tidy data in which observations are spread across columns, as in Table 6 (the gapminder dataset). pivot_wider is used to tidy data in which observations are spread across rows, as in Table 7 (the gapminder dataset). You will find yourself using these functions, particularly pivot_longer not only for fixing messy data, but for flexibly reshaping data for use in ggplot2 specifications (more on this in sessions 3 and 4) or joining tables.\nA quick breakdown of pivot_longer:\npivot_longer( data, cols, # Columns to pivot longer (across rows). names_to=\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;, # Name of the column where for pivoted variables. values_to=\u0026quot;name\u0026quot; ) A quick breakdown of pivot_wider:\npivot_wider( data, names_from, # Column in the long format which contains what will be column names in the wide format. values_from # Column in the long format which contains what will be values in the new wide format. ) In the homework you will be tidying some messy derived tables based on the bikeshare data using both of these functions, but we can demonstrate both of these functions in tidying the messy gapminder data in Table 7. Remember that these data were messy as the observations by gender were spread across the columns:\nuntidy_wide ## country year f_cases m_cases f_population m_population ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 447 298 9993400 9993671 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 1599 1067 10296280 10299080 ## 3 Brazil 1999 16982 20755 86001181 86005181 ## 4 Brazil 2000 39440 41048 87251329 87253569 ## 5 China 1999 104007 108252 636451250 636464022 ## 6 China 2000 104746 109759 640212600 640215983 First we need to gather the problematic columns with pivot_wider.\nuntidy_wide %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(cols=c(f_cases: m_population), names_to=c(\u0026quot;gender_count_type\u0026quot;), values_to=c(\u0026quot;counts\u0026quot;)) ## country year gender_count_type counts ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 f_cases 447 ## 2 Afghanistan 1999 m_cases 298 ## 3 Afghanistan 1999 f_population 9993400 ## 4 Afghanistan 1999 m_population 9993671 ## 5 Afghanistan 2000 f_cases 1599 ## 6 Afghanistan 2000 m_cases 1067 ## 7 Afghanistan 2000 f_population 10296280 ## 8 Afghanistan 2000 m_population 10299080 ## 9 Brazil 1999 f_cases 16982 ## 10 Brazil 1999 m_cases 20755 ## # … with 14 more rows So this has usefully collapsed the dataset by gender, we now have a problem similar to that in Table 6 where observations are spread across the rows – in this instance cases and population are better treated as separate variables. This can be fixed by separating the gender_count_type variables and then spreading the values of the new count_type (cases, population) across the columns. Hopefully you can see how this gets us to the tidy gapminder data structure in Table 5\nuntidy_wide %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(cols=c(f_cases: m_population), names_to=c(\u0026quot;gender_count_type\u0026quot;), values_to=c(\u0026quot;counts\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% separate(col=gender_count_type, into=c(\u0026quot;gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;count_type\u0026quot;), sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) ## country year gender count_type counts ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 f cases 447 ## 2 Afghanistan 1999 m cases 298 ## 3 Afghanistan 1999 f population 9993400 ## 4 Afghanistan 1999 m population 9993671 ## 5 Afghanistan 2000 f cases 1599 ## 6 Afghanistan 2000 m cases 1067 ## 7 Afghanistan 2000 f population 10296280 ## 8 Afghanistan 2000 m population 10299080 ## 9 Brazil 1999 f cases 16982 ## 10 Brazil 1999 m cases 20755 ## # … with 14 more rows untidy_wide %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(cols=c(f_cases: m_population), names_to=c(\u0026quot;gender_count_type\u0026quot;), values_to=c(\u0026quot;counts\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% separate(col=gender_count_type, into=c(\u0026quot;gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;count_type\u0026quot;), sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% pivot_wider(names_from=count_type, values_from=counts) ## country year gender cases population ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 f 447 9993400 ## 2 Afghanistan 1999 m 298 9993671 ## 3 Afghanistan 2000 f 1599 10296280 ## 4 Afghanistan 2000 m 1067 10299080 ## 5 Brazil 1999 f 16982 86001181 ## 6 Brazil 1999 m 20755 86005181 ## 7 Brazil 2000 f 39440 87251329 ## 8 Brazil 2000 m 41048 87253569 ## 9 China 1999 f 104007 636451250 ## 10 China 1999 m 108252 636464022 ## 11 China 2000 f 104746 640212600 ## 12 China 2000 m 109759 640215983   Conclusions Developing the vocabulary and technical skills to systematically describe and organise data is crucial to modern data analysis. This session has covered the fundamentals here: that data consist of observations and variables of different types (Stevens 1946) and that in order to work effectively with datasets, especially in a functional way in R, these data must be organised according to the rules of tidy data (Wickham 2014). Most of the session content was dedicated to the techniques that enable these concepts to be operationalised. We covered how to download, transform and reshape a reasonably large set of data from New York’s Citibike scheme. In doing so, we generated insights that might inform further data collection and analysis activity. In the next session we will apply and extend this conceptual and technical knowledge as we introduce the fundamental of visual data analysis and ggplot2’s grammar of graphics.\n References Lovelace, Beecham, R. 2020. “Is the London Cycle Hire Scheme Becoming More Inclusive?

This course will go beyond traditional ideas of charts, graphs, maps (and also statistics!) to equip you with the critical analysis, design and technical skills to analyse and communicate with geographic datasets.\nThe course emphasises real-world applications. You will work with both new, large-scale behavioural datasets, as well as more traditional, administrative datasets located within various social science domains: Political Science, Crime Science, Urban and Transport Planning. As well as learning how to use graphics and statistics to explore patterns in these data, implementing recent ideas from data journalism you will learn how to communicate research findings – how to tell stories with data.\n Module objectives By the end of the course you will\nDescribe, process and combine geographic datasets from a range of sources Design statistical graphics that expose structure in geographic data and that are underpinned by established principles in information visualization and cartography Use modern data science and visualization frameworks to produce coherent, reproducible data analyses Apply modern statistical techniques for analysing, representing and communicating data and model uncertainty   Assessment A detailed and formal description of the Assessment for this module can be found on the Minerva pages. The summative assessment consists of:\n 30% (Decrease to 20%) - Portfolio of work from completing session homework 70% (Increase to 80%) - Fully reproducible project report   Software All work in the module – data collection, analysis and reporting – will be completed using R and the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Along with Python R is the programming environment for modern data analysis.\n Module breakdown   Week 1 Introduction      Week 2 Data fundamentals      Week 3 Visualization fundamentals      Week 4 Visualization for exploratory data analysis         Week 5 Visualization for exploratory geospatial data analysis         Week 6 Visualization for model building 1         Week 7 Visualization for model building 2         Week 8 Visualization for uncertainty analysis           Navigating the course materials The home for this module is this website. From here, you will find the course Schedule (also above), where for each session there is  Reading,  Class content and  Homework. Also accompanying each session is an R Markdown file with a template to complete coding activities introduced through the class and homework pages. These session templates contain pre-prepared code chunks for you to execute. As the module progresses and you become more familiar and competent in R, you will be required to contribute more code of your own to these.\nAs you work through the course materials you will notice special icons are used to distinguish learning outcomes  and instructions  that need to be completed, along with important informational asides . Do pay special attention to these, and in particular revisit the learning outcomes  as you progress through the sessions.\nUse Minerva to access the Module Handbook and to upload assignments in the usual way.\n Self-guided learning  The bad news is whenever you’re learning a new tool, for a long time you’re going to suck. It’s going to be very frustrating. But, the good news is that that is typical, it’s something that happens to everyone, and it’s only temporary … [T]here is no way to go from knowing nothing about a subject to knowing something about a subject and being an expert in it without going through a period of great frustration.\"\nHadley Wickham\n From the module overview and outline you will have got the sense that this is a reasonably technical module. You will be introduced to the key components of modern data analysis (Data Science) through doing – the course inevitably requires you to do a fair amount of “coding”, in this case in R.\nIt is understandable if this feels like a daunting prospect. The barrier to entry is greater than with point-and-click interfaces such as ArcGIS and SPSS. So do expect that this module may require a degree of patience and persistence – but isn’t that true of all things that are worth learning?\nIn order reduce the pain, I’ve tried to include within the module a balance of content between programming fundamentals, theoretical/conceptual learning and more procedural ‘grunt-work’ with datasets. I have also carefully considered and incorporated ideas from some of the really high quality Resources out there aimed at lowering the barrier to doing Data Science in R.\nIn return, I expect you to:\n Read all course materials Complete the class session tasks, homework and coursework assignment Participate in the discussion forum   Slack A key mechanism through which you can participate is by contributing to the discussion forum. Engaging fully with this will help to foster a sort of collegiate atmosphere on the module that will maximise your learning. I have set up a course Slack, which should provide a useful mechanism for sharing information, resources and importantly posting and discussing code.\nIf you’ve not used Slack before, then follow these pages on getting started with Slack. You should post all substantive questions associated with the module to Slack. These will get answered. If you wish to discuss more personal matters around your completing the course, then send those directly to me via e-mail.\n  Create an account on the vis-for-gds Slack. Be sue to register with you .leeds.ac.uk e-mail. If you run into any problems, try getting started with Slack.    Asking questions As many of you will be learning to program in R for the first time, you should expect to be baffled at times and to routinely encounter scary-looking ERROR messages. Counterintuitively, this is actually to be welcomed. You need to be making mistakes and hitting obstacles on a regular basis if you are to progress.\nHow you respond to these obstacles is important. In a face-to-face lab, the temptation when hitting a problem is to raise your hand, gesture towards your screen and have a demonstrator ‘de-bug’ for you. Whilst this may initially seem like an efficient solution, you risk learning very little if this is your only course of action.\nWhen you encounter problems working through the material in this course, try to force yourself to spend 15-20 minutes troubleshooting the problem individually. Google your problem or try StackOverflow. If you are not able to resolve the problem on your own, then post your question to the course Slack, which I will monitor regularly. When doing this, make an effort to be specific and unambiguous about your problem. You might wish to consult StackOverflow’s guidance on how to ask a good question.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en-uk","lastmod":1606644925,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Overview Module objectives Assessment Software Module breakdown Navigating the course materials Self-guided learning Slack Asking questions   Instructor  Roger Beecham  10.139 Manton Building  r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk  @rjbeecham   Course details  Wednesdays  25th May - 13th Jul  10:00 - 12:00  ODL   Contacting me Questions to do with the substantive aspects of the module should be directed to the #general channel of the course Slack in the first instance.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
